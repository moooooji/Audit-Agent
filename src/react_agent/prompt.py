System: You are an expert threat-modeling assistant specializing in Web3 and smart contract security. Your goal is to extract key elements from system documentation (typically whitepapers, litepapers, or high-level architectural descriptions) to facilitate threat modeling. **Be mindful that these documents primarily describe concepts and mechanisms, and may not contain code-level implementation details.**

Context:
Here is the system documentation:
{target_docs}

Task:
1. Extract all **actors** mentioned in the documentation. For each actor include:
    - `id`: unique integer
    - `name`: actor name (e.g., "User", "Protocol DAO", "Validator Node")
    - `type`: actor category (e.g., "External User", "Internal Governance Body", "Network Participant")
    - `description`: short description if given
    - `capabilities`: list of actions or permissions the actor has, as described in the documentation (e.g., "can stake tokens to participate in consensus", "can submit proposals for protocol upgrades")
2. Extract all **assets** mentioned in the documentation, **focusing on those central to the protocol's economic model, security, or core functionality as described in the whitepaper.**
3. Extract all **components** (e.g., core protocol mechanisms, specific smart contract functionalities if detailed, off-chain services), with their `trust_level` if given, and list of managed asset IDs.
4. Extract all **data_flows** between components, referencing by IDs, **based on the interactions and information exchanges described in the whitepaper.**
5. Extract all **trust_boundaries** and which components they separate, referencing by IDs.
6. Extract all **behaviors** describing actions initiated by an actor or component toward another component, **focusing on key interactions with the protocol's described functionalities (e.g., participating in staking, executing a governance decision).**
7. **Document Analysis Rationale**: For each category (actors, assets, components, data_flows, trust_boundaries, behaviors), provide specific justification explaining:
   - **Source Reference**: Which specific section/page/chapter of the documentation was used as evidence
   - **Extraction Logic**: Why each item was identified and categorized the way it was
   - **Risk Assessment Basis**: What criteria or information from the documentation justified the assigned risk/trust/sensitivity levels
   - **Scope Decisions**: Why certain potential items were included or excluded from the analysis
   - **Assumptions Made**: Any interpretations or assumptions when documentation was ambiguous
   
   Each rationale should be traceable, specific, and demonstrate thorough analysis of the source material.



After extraction, **validate each item** against the source text:
- If an entry is inaccurate or attributes are wrong, **correct** it.
- If it is already accurate, **leave it unchanged**.

Output Requirements:
- Return **only** valid JSON (no extra text).
- Use this schema exactly:

**Guidelines**:

* **Quality > Quantity**: Prefer 1 strong checklist item over 3 weak ones.
* **Be specific**: "Verify authentication" is vague. Instead say "Verify that forum requires wallet-based login for RFRV submitters."
* **Trace everything**: Each checklist item must quote an assumption or mitigation as its justification.
* **Use judgment**: If the mitigation is trivial (e.g., "add logging") but doesn't align with the actual threat, do not generate an item.

**System:** You are a Senior Threat Modeling Analyst responsible for generating the **final, validated** checklist output.

**Context:**

You are given:

1. **System Documentation** – The authoritative source describing system architecture, threats, and security concerns.
   {context}

2. **Initial Draft Checklist** – A structured JSON generated by an LLM based on the documentation, using the following schema: checklist_items. Each item includes fields like `id`, `title`, `description`, `linked_threat_id`, `category`, `check_type`, `target_entity`, `target_type`, and `security_property`.
   {initial_checklist}

3. **Panel Validation Findings** – Expert review that identifies hallucinations, missing checks, schema violations, or ambiguous entries in the draft checklist.
   {assessment_checklist}

---

**Task:**
Generate a **final, corrected JSON checklist** that:

1. **IMPORTANT: RETAIN ALL ITEMS THAT WERE NOT FLAGGED IN THE FINDINGS**. Only remove or modify items that are explicitly mentioned in the findings.
2. **Removes or corrects ONLY** the items that were explicitly flagged as hallucinated, ambiguous, or schema-invalid in the findings.
3. **Adds** any **missing but justified** checklist items that are clearly supported by the context and mentioned in the findings.
4. Ensures all items are:
   * Directly traceable to the context
   * Fully schema-compliant
   * Consistent in fields like ID, references, categories, and technical accuracy

5. **Individual Checklist Correction Rationale**: For each corrected/retained checklist item, provide a specific judgment basis explaining:
   - **Checklist Item ID**: The unique identifier of the checklist item being analyzed
   - **Item Selection Logic**: Why this specific checklist item was generated from the threat analysis and what specific threat aspects it addresses
   - **Priority Assignment Reasoning**: What factors determined the priority level (High/Medium/Low) for this specific checklist item
   - **Category Mapping Justification**: How the STRIDE threat category was mapped to this checklist category and why that mapping is appropriate
   - **Code Binding Assessment**: Whether this item requires code-level verification and why, based on the technical nature of the specific threat
   - **Evidence Requirements Analysis**: Why the specific evidence type was chosen for this item and how it validates the security control
   - **Actionability Verification**: How this item provides clear, executable steps for security verification rather than vague guidelines

   Each checklist item should have its own dedicated judgment basis that explains the reasoning specific to that item.

**Strict Requirements:**

* **DO NOT REMOVE items unless they are explicitly flagged in the findings**. If an item is not mentioned in the findings, it MUST be retained.

CHECKLIST_ASSESSMENT_TEMPLATE = """
**System:** You are an Expert Panel for Security Checklist Validation.

**Context:**
- Below is the original threat analysis that identifies risks within the system:

{threat_analysis}

- Based on this threat analysis, an initial set of security checklist items was generated in structured JSON format. These items include fields such as `id`, `title`, `description`, `linked_threat_id`, `category`, `check_type`, `target_entity`, `target_type`, and `security_property`.

Initial checklist to review:

{initial_checklist}

**Task:**  
You are to review the generated **initial checklist** with the goal of validating its correctness, traceability to the threat model, and usefulness as a security review tool. Please assess the following:

1. **Traceability** – Is each checklist item clearly linked to a relevant threat in the analysis? Flag any hallucinated or unsupported items.
    
2. **Completeness** – Are there any important checks missing based on the threat analysis or known security practices?
    
3. **Schema Compliance** – Does each item conform to the expected structure (e.g., required fields present, ID uniqueness)?
    
4. **Relevance & Clarity** – Is each item specific, technically actionable, and clearly written?

**Instructions:**
- Provide a brief evaluation summary of the `checklist_items` overall.
- Then return a list of **validation findings** in the following format:

{
  "evaluation_summary": "Summary of the validation",
  "findings": [
    {
      "category": "checklist_items",
      "type": "missing",
      "checklist_id": null,
      "description": "Checklist missing for input validation on governance proposal submission, which is mentioned as a risk in the threat model."
    },
    {
      "category": "checklist_items",
      "type": "hallucinated",
      "checklist_id": 2,
      "description": "Checklist references biometric authentication, but this is not mentioned in the threat analysis."
    },
    {
      "category": "checklist_items",
      "type": "schema_error",
      "checklist_id": 3,
      "description": "`target_type` is missing or invalid."
    },
    {
      "category": "checklist_items",
      "type": "clarity_issue",
      "checklist_id": 1,
      "description": "Checklist title is too vague; needs to specify what identity checks are being verified."
    }
  ]
}

**Strict Review Principles:**

- Base all judgments strictly on what is written in `{threat_analysis}` and found in `{initial_checklist}`.
- If a checklist item is not clearly supported by the threat context, it must be flagged.
- Each item should be practical, traceable, and clearly contribute to mitigating a specific threat.

CODE_BINDING_ASSESSMENT_TEMPLATE = """
**System:** You are a Security Engineer responsible for validating the correctness and completeness of a threat-to-code binding process.

**Context:**

You are given:

1. **Code Binding Output** – A JSON array of one or more `threats` that have been mapped to relevant source code locations or evidence (e.g., files, functions, or lines).
   {code_binding}

2. **Checklist Items** – A structured list of checklist items that were originally generated to mitigate or detect these threats. Each checklist item includes `id`, `description`, `linked_threat_id`, and additional metadata.
   {checklist_items}

---

**Task:**

Evaluate the **code binding output** in relation to the checklist items and documentation. You must verify:

1. **Traceability** – For each checklist item, does the mapped code artifact clearly correspond to the **linked checklist item**? Is the evidence valid and well-supported?

2. **Completeness** – Are there any checklist items that are **not covered** by any code binding? Flag if a checklist item has no corresponding implementation or test.

3. **Relevance & Accuracy** – Is the bound code artifact actually relevant to the security concern? Are the file paths, functions, or logic well-scoped and justified?

4. **Schema Compliance** – Does the code binding object include the required fields: `checklist_id`, `file_path`, `function`, `reason`?

5. If the code binding results need to retry code binding(e.g. the code binding results are not matched with the checklist item), set `need_code_binding` to true

---

**Important:** If `need_retry_code_binding` is `true` for any finding, you **must** include a `retry_guidance` field. This field should provide specific instructions or suggestions for improving the code binding, such as:

*   Which specific files, functions, or code sections to look for.
*   Why the current binding is insufficient or incorrect.
*   What kind of evidence or logic would be more relevant to the threat.
*   Any alternative approaches or considerations for finding the correct code binding.

**Instructions:**

- Provide a concise **summary** of the overall validation.
- Then return a list of findings in this schema:

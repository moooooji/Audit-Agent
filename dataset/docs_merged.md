## Berachain Governance

*파일 경로: governance.md*

Source: https://docs.berachain.com/learn/governance/

## Berachain Governance [​](#berachain-governance)

Berachain's decentralized governance system empowers `$BGT` token holders to make important decisions on core functions of Proof-of-Liquidity & other core dApps. Here are a few examples of what governance can be used for:

*   [Reward Vault whitelisting](/learn/governance/rewardvault) (e.g. new staking assets, whitelisting incentive assets)
*   Native dApp governance (e.g. changes to BEX's protocol fees)

### Governance Lifecycle [​](#governance-lifecycle)

Berachain's governance process is derived from OpenZeppelin's [Governance contracts](https://docs.openzeppelin.com/contracts/5.x/governance), which prescribes a multi-step governance lifecycle.

![Governance Process](/assets/governance-process.png)

The governance lifecycle on Berachain follows several stages:

1.  **Proposal Creation**: Any user with sufficient voting power can create a governance proposal.
    
2.  **Pending State**: Once created, the proposal enters a waiting period before becoming active for voting.
    
3.  **Active Voting**: During the voting period, `$BGT` holders can cast their votes.
    
4.  **Proposal Outcome**: After the voting period, the proposal is either marked as Succeeded or Defeated. A quorum of `$BGT` is required for a proposal to pass.
    
5.  **Timelock**: If the proposal succeeds, it enters a queue with a timelock delay.
    
6.  **Execution**: After the timelock period, the proposal can be executed, implementing the proposed changes.
    

### Guardian Oversight [​](#guardian-oversight)

During the **Timelock** period, Berachain's guardian system provides an additional layer of security. Guardians can cancel malicious proposals during the timelock period (e.g., hostile takeover, unauthorized code changes) to protect the Berachain ecosystem. Guardians act through a 5-of-9 multisig with elected signers.

### Creating your Governance Proposal [​](#creating-your-governance-proposal)

Governance proposals can be discussed and created on [BeraHub](https://hub.berachain.com/governance/general/) . Creating a governance proposal on requires adhering to the following:

*   **Ensure Sufficient Voting Power**: You need sufficient `$BGT`, either owned directly or delegated to you by other token holders.
    
*   **Delegate `$BGT`**: Even if you own the required `$BGT`, you must delegate it to yourself (or have it delegated by others) to gain voting power.
    
*   **Prepare Your Proposal**: Clearly define the changes you want to implement. For example, to whitelist a Reward Vault to the BeraChef contract, you would need to specify the vault address and encode the correct function signature.
    
*   **Submit the Proposal**: Use the governance contract to submit your proposal on-chain. This typically involves calling a `propose` function with the necessary parameters.
    
*   **Monitor and Participate**: Once submitted, monitor your proposal's progress through the various stages. Encourage other `$BGT` holders to vote and participate in discussions about your proposal.
    
*   **Execute if Passed**: If your proposal passes and completes the timelock period, you or another user can execute it to implement the changes.
    

Reward Vault whitelisting proposals follow a specific streamlined process. Please refer to [Reward Vault Governance](/learn/governance/rewardvault).

## Berachain NFTs [​](#berachain-nfts)

Berachain's journey began rather unconventionally. What started as a bear-themed NFT project in 2021 eventually evolved into a novel blockchain pioneering Proof-of-Liquidity, thanks in part to the strong builder community rallying around the NFTs.

### Official Collections [​](#official-collections)

There are six NFT collections that form Berachain's official NFTs. Each collection builds upon previous ones through a rebasing mechanism whereby holders of all previous collections are rewarded NFTs from subsequent collections. For example, a **Bong Bear** (the original collection) holder would receive 1 **Bond Bear**, and subsequently 2 **Boo Bears** for holding the first two collections.

Following are OpenSea links to each collection, in the order they were released:

*   [Bong Bears](https://opensea.io/collection/bongbears)
*   [Bond Bears](https://opensea.io/collection/bond-bears)
*   [Boo Bears](https://opensea.io/collection/boo-bears)
*   [Baby Bears](https://opensea.io/collection/the-baby-bears)
*   [Band Bears](https://opensea.io/collection/the-band-bears)
*   [Bit Bears](https://opensea.io/collection/berachain-bit-bears)

See the [deployed contracts](/developers/deployed-contracts) for the relevant addresses on both Ethereum and Berachain.

### Bridge Your Bears [​](#bridge-your-bears)

All six official collections can be bridged from Ethereum to Berachain using the Berachain NFT bridge. Bridging is necessary for holders to claim the [airdrop](/learn/claim-bera-airdrop).

## Proof-of-Liquidity Overview 📓

*파일 경로: pol.md*

Source: https://docs.berachain.com/learn/pol/

## Proof-of-Liquidity Overview 📓 [​](#proof-of-liquidity-overview-📓)

Proof-of-Liquidity (PoL) is an extension of Proof-of-Stake (PoS) that realigns economic incentives among validators, applications, and users. This is enabled through a two-token model - a token responsible for chain security (`$BERA`) and a token responsible for governance and rewards (`$BGT`).

### Core Components [​](#core-components)

#### Security Layer ($BERA) [​](#security-layer-bera)

Berachain's Active Set of validators (validators participating in consensus) is determined by validators' `$BERA` stake, with a minimum of `250,000 $BERA` and a maximum cap of `10,000,000 $BERA`. The top 69 validators ranked by stake are in the Active Set. Within the Active Set, a validator's probability of proposing a block is proportional to their staked `$BERA` — more `$BERA` staked increases the likelihood of proposing a block.

#### Reward Layer ($BGT) [​](#reward-layer-bgt)

The size of a validator's `$BGT` block reward is determined by their Boost, which is a percentage calculated from the validator's `$BGT` boost divided by the total `$BGT` boosted to all validators. Boosts are obtained when `$BGT` holders delegate to validators.

Learn more about how emissions are calculated on the [emissions page](./bgtmath).

### PoL Lifecycle [​](#pol-lifecycle)

![Berachain Proof-of-Liquidity Steps](/assets/proof-of-liquidity-steps.png)

#### 1\. Validator Lifecycle [​](#_1-validator-lifecycle)

The journey begins when a Prospective Validator stakes their `$BERA` as a security bond (①). Validators are chosen to propose blocks with a probability proportional to their staked amount (②). For each block proposed, the validator receives both a base emission and a variable reward emission based on their boost percentage (③) (see [emissions](./bgtmath)).

#### 2\. Reward Distribution [​](#_2-reward-distribution)

After collecting the base `$BGT` rewards for themselves, validators direct the remaining variable `$BGT` rewards to whitelisted [Reward Vaults](/learn/pol/rewardvaults) of their choosing (④). In exchange for directing their emissions, validators receive protocol-provided [Incentives](/learn/pol/incentives) from Reward Vaults (the `$BGT` is earned by users supplying liquidity to the protocol).

#### 3\. Liquidity Provider Flow [​](#_3-liquidity-provider-flow)

The ecosystem's liquidity providers (i.e., users) play a crucial role in PoL. Users can provide liquidity to protocols like BEX (⑤) and receive receipt tokens as proof of their contribution (⑥). These receipt tokens are then staked in Reward Vaults (⑦), where users earn `$BGT` proportional to their share of the vault (⑧).

#### 4\. Delegation Cycle [​](#_4-delegation-cycle)

As `$BGT` Holders accumulate tokens, they can delegate them to validators (⑨), directly influencing the validator's boost. This creates a virtuous cycle where higher delegation leads to increased validator boost, resulting in larger `$BGT` emissions when that validator proposes blocks. Validators are incentivized to share their received protocol Incentives with delegators to attract more boosts, fostering a collaborative ecosystem.

### Ecosystem Alignment 🤝 [​](#ecosystem-alignment-🤝)

By integrating Berachain's native network rewards among all ecosystem participants, PoL creates alignment between:

*   **Validators**: Need `$BGT` delegation to maximize their block rewards and must efficiently direct emissions to reward vaults to earn Incentives and attract more boost.
*   **Protocols**: Compete for `$BGT` emissions by offering attractive Incentive rates in their reward vaults
*   **Users**: Earn `$BGT` by providing liquidity, then delegate to validators who maximize returns

## What Is BeaconKit? ⛵✨

*파일 경로: what_is_beaconkit.md*

Source: https://docs.berachain.com/learn/what-is-beaconkit

## What Is BeaconKit? ⛵✨ [​](#what-is-beaconkit-⛵✨)

BeaconKit is a modular and customizable consensus layer for Ethereum-based blockchains.

[

![BeaconKit GitHub Repository](/assets/beacon-kit-github-repository.png)

](https://github.com/berachain/beacon-kit)

> Check out the official [BeaconKit GitHub Repository](https://github.com/berachain/beacon-kit).

BeaconKit is an innovative framework that makes the [CometBFT](https://docs.cometbft.com/v0.38/) consensus algorithm available to arbitrary EVM execution environments. In other words, BeaconKit is a modular [consensus layer](/learn/help/glossary#consensus-client) that is adaptable for Ethereum-based blockchains.

BeaconKit packages the CometBFT consensus algorithm with a modular middleware layer capable of receiving blocks from any execution environment that conforms to the [Engine API](/learn/help/glossary#engine-api) specification. This allows those blocks to be processed through CometBFT consensus. In practice, this enables support for unmodified EVM [execution clients](/learn/help/glossary#execution-client) to run on top of BeaconKit, allowing chains to be [EVM identical](/learn/#berachain-evm-identical-⟠).

The framework is built with modularity in mind and can be extended with different layers that may include a custom block builder, a rollup layer, a data availability layer, and others. This modularity enables the building of not only Layer 1 blockchains but also serves as a framework for Layer 2 solutions.

### BeaconKit Advantages [​](#beaconkit-advantages)

Running a BeaconKit-based chain provides several advantages (assuming the default configuration of pairing with an EVM execution client):

*   Single slot finality (compared to Ethereum's ~13 minutes)
*   Optimistic payload building (executing block proposal in parallel with voting) reduces block times by up to 40%
*   Conformity to Eth2 modularity
*   Full EIP compatibility

## What is Berachain? 🐻⛓️ [​](#what-is-berachain)

[

![Berachain.com](/assets/berachaindotcom.png)

](https://berachain.com/)

Berachain is a high-performance [EVM-Identical](#berachain-evm-identical-⟠) Layer 1 blockchain utilizing [Proof-of-Liquidity](#proof-of-liquidity-🤝) (PoL) and built on top of the modular EVM-focused consensus client framework [BeaconKit](#beaconkit-⛵✨).

### EVM Identical ⟠ [​](#evm-identical-⟠)

Berachain's execution layer is identical to the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) runtime environment seen on Ethereum Mainnet. This means that it uses existing unmodified [execution clients](/learn/help/glossary#execution-client) like Geth, Reth, Erigon, Nethermind, and more to handle executing smart contracts and supports all the tooling that comes native with the EVM.

Identical means that whenever the EVM is upgraded, Berachain can adopt the latest version—for example, Dencun—straight out of the box. This includes compatibility with all RPC namespaces and endpoints, and any improvements made to execution clients can be applied immediately to Berachain.

### Proof-of-Liquidity 🤝 [​](#proof-of-liquidity-🤝)

Proof-of-Liquidity radically changes the way L1 economics are structured, prioritizing users and applications over validator rewards at baseline. Network incentives go towards enriching ecosystem liquidity, contributing to efficient trading, price stability, securing the chain, and increasing network/user growth.

PoL strongly aligns the incentives of [network participants](/learn/pol/participants) (validators, protocols, users) and contributes to the overall long-term health of the chain.

Beyond providing seamless day-one utility, the native dApps, such as [BEX](/learn/dapps/bex), serve as reference implementations of how developers can build on top of Proof-of-Liquidity.

### BeaconKit ⛵✨ [​](#beaconkit-⛵✨)

BeaconKit is a modular framework developed by Berachain for building EVM [consensus clients](/learn/help/glossary#consensus-client). It integrates the benefits of CometBFT consensus, including increased composability, [single slot finality (SSF)](https://ethereum.org/en/roadmap/single-slot-finality/), and more.

## What is Proof-of-Liquidity? 🤝

*파일 경로: what_is_proof_of_liquidity.md*

Source: https://docs.berachain.com/learn/what-is-proof-of-liquidity

## What is Proof-of-Liquidity? 🤝 [​](#what-is-proof-of-liquidity-🤝)

Proof-of-Liquidity (PoL) is a novel economic mechanism that uses network incentives to align the interests of ecosystem participants and bolster both application-layer and chain security.

### Two Token Model [​](#two-token-model)

Berachain's consensus borrows from the Proof-of-Stake (PoS) model and contains two key components:

1.  [`$BERA`](/learn/pol/tokens/bera) - Validators secure the chain by staking the native gas token
2.  [`$BGT`](/learn/pol/tokens/bgt) - A soulbound governance token distributed by validators for proposing new blocks, which is ultimately rewarded to users who provide ecosystem liquidity (see [Reward Vaults](./pol/rewardvaults))

A validator's `$BGT` emissions increase with the amount of `$BGT` delegated to them. Protocol-provided [Incentives](/learn/pol/incentives) are received for these emissions, and validators pass these to their delegators after collecting a commission.

This model creates meaningful economic alignment between previously isolated groups. Validators who return the maximum value to their `$BGT` delegators are likely to receive more delegations.

![Proof-of-Liquidity Flywheel](/assets/proof-of-liquidity-flywheel.png)

#### Separation of Concerns [​](#separation-of-concerns)

Significantly, Proof-of-Liquidity separates the token responsible for gas and security from the token used to govern chain rewards and economic incentives.

The following diagram illustrates the roles of tokens in Berachain's PoL compared to Ethereum's PoS:

Pool deposits in BEX can become eligible for [$BGT](/learn/pol/tokens/bgt) emissions and incentivization by whitelisting associated [Reward Vaults](/learn/pol/rewardvaults) via governance.

> To learn more, check out the [Berachain BEX Docs](https://docs.bex.berachain.com/).

### Default Reward Allocation [​](#default-reward-allocation)

Each validator can customize how their rewards are distributed across different reward vaults. If no custom allocation is set, default allocations are used, benefitting key BEX liquidity pools. The default allocation is as follows:

## 📁 help / Berachain Frequently Asked Questions ❓

*파일 경로: help/faqs.md*

Source: https://docs.berachain.com/learn/help/faqs

## Berachain Frequently Asked Questions ❓ [​](#berachain-frequently-asked-questions-❓)

### What do Berachain's performance metrics look like? [​](#what-do-berachain-s-performance-metrics-look-like)

Berachain has the following properties:

*   Block time: Block times vary, for the latest feel free to check it out at [BeraScan Block Explorer](https://berascan.com/).
*   Transactions per Second (TPS): This can vary but the following should help with the number of possible transactions (Block gas limit (30m) / Average gas limit per txn) / Block time (2s) = TPS.
*   Finality: single slot finality

### What is a DEX? [​](#what-is-a-dex)

DEX stands for Decentralized Exchange. It is a place where you can buy and sell tokens that lives directly on the chain instead of being run by any one centralized service. This means that all liquidity can be seen directly on-chain, and is verifiably owned by the smart contracts themselves. A DEX enables you to swap tokens directly from your wallet, as well as allowing anyone to launch their own tokens and provide liquidity.

### What is a swap? [​](#what-is-a-swap)

A swap is the process of exchanging one token for another. This can be thought of as a buy or a sell, depending on which token you're looking at. For example, if you're looking to buy `$BERA` with `$ETH`, you would be swapping `$ETH` for `$BERA`. This is essentially "selling" `$ETH` and "buying" `$BERA`.

### How much does it cost to swap? [​](#how-much-does-it-cost-to-swap)

Each swap has a fee which varies depending on the fee that was set when the pool was created. Common fees are 0.05%, 0.1%, 0.3% or 1% but you should always check when performing a swap to ensure you are okay with the fee on that pool.

### What is liquidity? [​](#what-is-liquidity)

Liquidity is the term for the amount of a token that is available to be swapped. The more liquidity a token has, the easier it is to swap that token.

### What is a liquidity pool? [​](#what-is-a-liquidity-pool)

Liquidity pools are pairings of 2 or more tokens that liquidity providers deposit tokens into. This enables DEX users to swap between any of the tokens in the pool.

### What is a liquidity provider? [​](#what-is-a-liquidity-provider)

Liquidity providers are users who deposit tokens into a liquidity pool. They are rewarded with a portion of the fees that are generated from swaps in the pool.

### What is APY? [​](#what-is-apy)

APY stands for annual percentage yield. In the context of BEX pools, this refers to the current APY for a given pool. APY yield comes from fees collected on every swap made using that pool.

### What is $HONEY? [​](#what-is-honey)

`$HONEY` is the native stablecoin of the Berachain ecosystem. It is a multicollateral backed stablecoin, and is used throughout the Berachain ecosystem.

### Does it cost anything to mint or burn $HONEY? [​](#does-it-cost-anything-to-mint-or-burn-honey)

In order to ensure stability, there is a small fee taken on every mint and burn of `$HONEY`. This fee is currently set to 0.2% of the amount minted or burned and can be changed via governance proposals.

Additionally, because minting & burning requires a transaction, there will be a small gas fee in `$BERA`.

### What stablecoins can I mint $HONEY with during Testnet? [​](#what-stablecoins-can-i-mint-honey-with-during-testnet)

There are various USD-pegged stablecoins that can be used to mint `$HONEY`. Currently, the following stablecoins are supported:

*   stgUSDC
*   BYUSD

More tokens may be added based on governance.

### What is `$BGT`? [​](#what-is-bgt)

$BGT is Berachain's staking & governance token. That means it is used to secure the network & earn rewards via Proof of Liquidity as well as to vote on governance proposals.

### What is a Validator? [​](#what-is-a-validator)

A validator can refer to three things:

1.  A blockchain node being run to validate transactions, produce blocks and come to consensus with other validators in the network
2.  The entity that owns and operates the validator node
3.  The blend of points #1 and #2 that manages a portion of Proof of Liquidity & Governance votes

### Why should I boost a validator with my `$BGT`? [​](#why-should-i-boost-a-validator-with-my-bgt)

Delegating `$BGT` allows you to participate in Proof of Liquidity while helping secure the network.

### Why should I boost my `$BGT` instead of burning it for `$BERA`? [​](#why-should-i-boost-my-bgt-instead-of-burning-it-for-bera)

Rewards are the main reason.

With Proof of Liquidity, you can earn many different types of rewards:

*   A share of protocol-provided [incentives](/learn/pol/incentives), provided in exchange for `$BGT` emissions directed to those protocols' Reward Vaults
*   A share of Berachain core dApp fees, namely fees from BEX and HoneySwap

### How do I get `$BGT`? [​](#how-do-i-get-bgt)

`$BGT` is earned through Reward Vaults when validators direct `$BGT` emissions towards Reward Vaults. See [Earning `$BGT`](/learn/pol/tokens/bgt#earning-bgt) for more.

### What is governance? [​](#what-is-governance)

Governance is the process by which the community decides what changes are made to the Berachain protocol. This includes how the node is upgraded and what parameters are set for various components on the chain.

### Once you've provided liquidity into an eligible pool in BEX (or some other PoL-eligible pool) how do you get `$BGT`? Is `$BGT` automatically sent to recipients? [​](#once-you-ve-provided-liquidity-into-an-eligible-pool-in-bex-or-some-other-pol-eligible-pool-how-do-you-get-bgt-is-bgt-automatically-sent-to-recipients)

Each eligible (whitelisted) pool on BEX has an associated LP token. Once liquidity is deposited into a BEX pool, an LP token would be issued relative to the user's total contribution percentage to the pool. With this LP token, users must stake (take an additional action) them into their respective Reward Vaults in order to be eligible to receive `$BGT`. As validators direct `$BGT` emissions to Reward Vaults, a user will accumulate `$BGT` to claim. Users must perform an additional action to claim `$BGT`, it is *NOT* automatically sent to the user. Users can claim their `$BGT` from any wallet address they choose.

### Can only Validators vote on or create proposals? [​](#can-only-validators-vote-on-or-create-proposals)

Anyone with the required minimum amounts of `$BGT` can propose and vote on proposals.

### What is the actual staking token of the network, `$BERA` or `$BGT`? [​](#what-is-the-actual-staking-token-of-the-network-bera-or-bgt)

*   Validators stake `$BERA`
*   Network incentives are received in `$BGT`

### Can validators with `$BERA` alone build blocks and what are the rewards? [​](#can-validators-with-bera-alone-build-blocks-and-what-are-the-rewards)

Yes, validators only need to stake `$BERA` within the designated min and max range of **250,000** and **10,000,000**, and once in the active set they will propose blocks. Validators receive rewards in `$BGT`.

### Do incentives only go to the validators with `$BGT` boost? [​](#do-incentives-only-go-to-the-validators-with-bgt-boost)

The incentives a validator receives depend solely on the amount of rewards offered in the specific reward vault that the validator chooses to fill.

### Can Reward Vaults route emissions to a single pool within a dApp, or only the whole dApp? [​](#can-reward-vaults-route-emissions-to-a-single-pool-within-a-dapp-or-only-the-whole-dapp)

The dApp can request a Reward Vault for any encapsulated thing they want. The encapsulated thing just requires a representative ERC-20 token that users can stake in the vault. Developers also have the ability to stake in Vaults on [behalf of users](/developers/guides/advanced-pol).

## 📁 pol / Block Production and Emissions

*파일 경로: pol/bgtmath.md*

Source: https://docs.berachain.com/learn/pol/bgtmath

## Block Production and Emissions [​](#block-production-and-emissions)

Proof-of-Liquidity governs block rewards and token emissions on Berachain using the `$BGT` token. This page explains the mathematical principles behind validator selection, block rewards, and emissions calculations.

### Validator Selection [​](#validator-selection)

The network maintains an active set of **69 validators** who are eligible for block production. Selection criteria include:

*   Only top **69 validators** by `$BERA` stake are included in active set
*   Block proposal probability is proportional to staked `$BERA` and does not affect reward amounts
*   Stake limitations per validator:
    *   Minimum: 250,000 `$BERA`
    *   Maximum: 10,000,000 `$BERA`

### $BGT Emissions Structure [​](#bgt-emissions-structure)

When a validator produces a block, `$BGT` tokens are emitted through two emission components:

1.  Base Emission
    
    *   **Fixed amount** equal to a `base rate` parameter (B)
    *   Paid directly to block-producing validator
2.  Reward Vault Emission
    
    *   **Variable amount** dependent on validator's boost (x)
        *   i.e. percentage of total `$BGT` delegated to the validator
    *   Distributed to [Reward Vaults](/learn/pol/rewardvaults) selected by validator
        *   Proportional to weights configured in the validator's [Reward Allocation](/nodes/guides/reward-allocation)
        *   Validators receive [Incentives](/learn/pol/incentives) from projects based on amounts directed to their Reward Vaults

### Validator Boosts [​](#validator-boosts)

Boost is a crucial metric that determines a validator's reward emissions:

*   Calculated as the percentage of `$BGT` delegation a validator has compared to the total `$BGT` delegated in the network
*   Expressed as a decimal between 0 and 1
*   Example: If a validator has 1000 `$BGT` delegated and the network has 10000 total `$BGT` delegated, their boost would be 0.1 (10%) Higher boost leads to higher reward emissions, subject to the emission formula

### $BGT Emissions Per Block [​](#bgt-emissions-per-block)

The total `$BGT` emitted per block is calculated using the following formula:

emission\=\[B+max(m,(a+1)(1−11+axb)R)\]

#### Parameters [​](#parameters)

Parameter

Description

Impact

x (boost)

Fraction of total `$BGT` delegated to validator (range: \[0,1\])

Determines `$BGT` emissions to Reward Vaults

B (base rate)

Fixed amount of 0.5 `$BGT` for block production

Determines baseline validator rewards

R (reward rate)

Base `$BGT` amount for reward vaults

Sets foundation for reward emissions

a (boost multiplier)

Boost impact coefficient

Higher values increase boost importance

b (convexity parameter)

Boost impact curve steepness

Higher values penalize low boost more severely

m (minimum boosted reward rate)

Floor for reward vault emissions

Higher values benefit low-boost validators

#### Sample Emissions Chart [​](#sample-emissions-chart)

Using the following sample parameters, we can visualize how emissions scale with `$BGT` delegation:

B\=0.4,R\=1.1,a\=3.5,b\=0.4,m\=0

![chart showing how emissions scale with `$BGT` delegation](/assets/updatedemission.Bkx_GIQH.png)

### Max Block Inflation [​](#max-block-inflation)

`$BGT` emissions grow with the amount of boost a validator has, up to a cap. The maximum theoretical block emission occurs at 100% boost:

maxE\[emission\]\=\[B+max(m,aR)\]

### `$BGT` Distribution [​](#bgt-distribution)

`$BGT` is emitted to reward vaults on a per-block basis via the [Distributor](./../../developers/contracts/distributor#distributefor) by invoking the `distributeFor` function. This invocation creates `$BGT` that is then claimable by [Reward Vault](./../pol/rewardvaults) stakers.

TIP

Rewards are created on a per-block basis; however, the distribution of rewards is done **over a three-day period.**

Rewards are streamed linearly over this period to depositors proportionally to their deposit amounts. The reward window is reset each time new rewards are added.

#### Distribution Example [​](#distribution-example)

On Berachain, `$BGT` is distributed per block, meaning that the three-day distribution period is consistently being pushed to "start" on the current block. Thus, this period should be viewed as a sliding window based on the emissions at any given time during the previous three days.

A more real-world example with simplified numbers can be used to understand distribution currently (taking place over 9 days):

*   3 `$BGT` distributed daily, for a total of 27 over 9 days
*   1 depositor, owning all the deposits

The distribution graph would be as follows:

![Complex Example](/assets/complex-emission.D5wrm6Ch.png)

**Legend**

*   Emitted: Total number of `$BGT` distributed and available
*   Claimable: Total number of `$BGT` able to be claimed by depositors
*   Daily Reward: Daily number of `$BGT` marked as claimable based on emitted tokens unlocks

This results in the depositor receiving an increasing amount of `$BGT` daily until rewards reach a saturation point after three days where all rewards are actively being distributed. Given that rewards are distributed on a frequent basis, the reward rate on a new reward vault should normalize after the initial three-day period.

Reward duration periods incentivize ecosystem alignment with depositors via this distribution mechanism rather than allowing rewards to be instantly claimed.

### Calculating Boost APR [​](#calculating-boost-apr)

Boost APR is shown throughout the [Berachain Hub](https://hub.berachain.com).

![Boost APR Example](/assets/boost-apr-example.CD03I8zt.png)

Boost APR % is calculated using ranges of blocks, defined by a starting block and an ending block. At the time the percentages are calculated, the APR calculator samples the prices of all tokens (in $BERA).

Initial variables:

*   Rc : cycle rate
*   Bs : starting block
*   tBs : timestamp of starting block
*   Be : ending block
*   tBe : timestamp of ending block
*   IT : incentive token
*   PT,tBe : price of token T at the end time of the block range

These variables are collected for the particular validator:

*   IT,b : incentive amount received by validator at given block b per given token T
*   BoosttBe : total BGT boost of the validator at ending time of the block range

Then, the APR for that validator is the sum over the range of all received incentives priced at the end time of the block range, divided by the total boost at the end time, priced with BERA price at final time, annualized.

R∗c\=∑∗T∈IT(∑∗b\=BsBeI∗T,b)×P∗T,t∗B∗eBoost∗t∗Be×P∗BERA,t\_BeAPR\=R∗c×T∗yeart∗Be−t∗Bs

Note that by “incentive received” we only consider incentives distributed by the RewardVault to the BGTIncentiveDistributor, tracked by the event BGTBoosterIncentivesProcessed (see contract code).

Amount in this calculation is net of commission, so per token it’s given by:

I\_T,b\=IRT×DistributedBGT×(1−C)

with:

*   IRT : incentive rate of token T
*   C : validator commission on incentives

## 📁 pol / Incentive Marketplace

*파일 경로: pol/incentives.md*

Source: https://docs.berachain.com/learn/pol/incentives

## Incentive Marketplace [​](#incentive-marketplace)

Proof-of-Liquidity (PoL) enables protocols to encourage validators to direct their `$BGT` emissions to a protocol's Reward Vault using whitelisted Incentive tokens. In doing so, protocols attract users to their protocol with `$BGT` rewards.

### How Incentives Work [​](#how-incentives-work)

Validators can capture Incentives offered by Whitelisted Reward Vaults by directing their $BGT emissions towards those Reward Vaults, defined by a validator's Reward Allocation - the list of Reward Vaults a validator directs percentages of its $BGT emissions to.

![Berachain Reward Vault Incentive Marketplace](/assets/berachain-incentive-marketplace.png)

#### Incentive Distribution Flow [​](#incentive-distribution-flow)

The distribution of Incentives follows this process:

1.  A **User** Boosts (by associating their $BGT with a validator) to increase a validator's $BGT emissions they receive when proposing a block.
2.  A **Validator** receives block rewards in the form of $BGT emissions, where the amount is influenced by Boost (see [$BGT Emissions Per Block](/learn/pol/bgtmath#bgt-emissions-per-block)), and directs emissions toward Whitelisted Reward Vaults chosen by the validator.
3.  A **Protocol** can offer up to two different Incentive Tokens to encourage validators to direct $BGT emissions to their Reward Vault.
4.  When the $BGT block reward emissions are distributed:
    *   The validator's operator address receives a commission (percentage of all the Incentive Tokens captured).
    *   The remaining Incentives, for users who boosted the validator, are sent to a contract and backend service that manages the distribution and claiming of these tokens. The backend API updates proofs of the user's entitlement to Incentive tokens every 24 hours. This eligibility never expires.
5.  A user (Booster) wanting to claim their Incentive token rewards retrieves this proof and claims their incentive token rewards through the [BGTIncentiveDistributor](/developers/contracts/bgtincentivedistributor) contract. All proof handling is done by interacting with [Berachain Hub](https://hub.berachain.com/).

#### Incentives & Users [​](#incentives-users)

As an overview, Incentives involve 3 different parties:

User

Description & Motivation

Booster

Any user that boosts a validator with $BGT. This increases a validator's $BGT emissions, allowing them to capture more Incentives from Reward Vaults. Boosters receive a portion of these Incentives.

Validator

A node in the Active Set that directs $BGT emissions to different Reward Vaults defined by their Reward Allocation distribution, captures Incentives from Reward Vaults, and takes a percentage (Commission Rate) of the Incentives captured.

Protocol

An entity, group, or organization that offers Incentive tokens for their respective Reward Vault with the goal of capturing $BGT emissions for their protocol and/or users.

### Incentive Mechanics [​](#incentive-mechanics)

Behind Incentives, there are additional mechanics to consider beyond the high-level overview of how distribution works.

#### Whitelisting Incentive Tokens [​](#whitelisting-incentive-tokens)

Only Whitelisted Reward Vaults can offer Incentives. A governance process must whitelist each Incentive Token, where the proposer needs to specify both the Token and a [Token Manager](#incentive-token-managers).

A Reward Vault can have up to two unique Incentive Tokens whitelisted. Adding or replacing a token requires passing a governance proposal.

#### Incentive Token Managers [​](#incentive-token-managers)

Only Incentive Token Managers of a Reward Vault can offer Incentives. One wallet address is responsible for offering an Incentive Token. The same wallet address can be set as a Token Manager for multiple Incentive Tokens.

A Governance proposal will specify Token Managers when proposing an Incentive Token. Changing a Token or Token Manager requires passing a governance proposal.

#### Offering Incentives [​](#offering-incentives)

A Reward Vault can offer up to two Incentive Tokens simultaneously. The offered amount cannot be withdrawn or revoked.

The Incentive Token Manager must define an Incentive Rate, greater than the minimum approved in the Governance proposal, when initially offering the Incentive Tokens and cannot decrease it until the supply of the Incentive Tokens offered has been exhausted by validators directing $BGT emissions. The Token Manager can deposit additional Incentive Tokens anytime, with an option to increase the rate at the same time.

Additionally, any user can contribute an Incentive Token amount to the Reward Vault, but the Token Manager will decide when to apply that amount and at a rate of their choosing.

BGT\=tokenAmountratePerBGT

Incentive Amount

Incentive Rate

Incentivized $BGT

2,000 $USDC

10 /$BGT

200 $BGT

Scenario: increase incentive rate 10% + deposit additional tokens (500 $USDC)

New Incentive Amount

New Incentive Rate

New Incentivized $BGT

2,500 $USDC

11 /$BGT

227 $BGT

Key takeaways are that Token Managers:

*   ✅ Can increase the Incentive Tokens by any number, keeping the same Incentive Rate.
*   ✅ Can increase the Incentive Rate when they deposit additional Incentive Tokens.
*   ✅ Can set a lower Incentive Rate only when the Incentive Tokens have been fully exhausted.
*   ❌ Cannot decrease the Incentive Rate while an existing Incentive is active.
*   ❌ Cannot reclaim or return the Incentive Tokens once they are added.

#### Incentive Commission and Distribution [​](#incentive-commission-and-distribution)

Each validator can set a percentage that they take as a commission of all Incentive Tokens received for directing $BGT emissions to different Reward Vaults offering Incentives. Every time $BGT block rewards are distributed, the validator will receive their commission rate of Incentive Tokens.

*Example:*

Incentive Tokens

Incentive Rate

100 $USDC

100 /$BGT

Validator A has an Incentive Commission of `5%` and directs 1 $BGT of emissions toward the Reward Vault.

From `100 $USDC`, the validator would get `5 $USDC`, based on their commission, leaving `95 $USDC` for anyone who boosted the validator, which can include themselves. The amount of Incentive Tokens distributed to each booster is based on their proportion of the total $BGT boosting that validator.

Party

$BGT Boost To Val A

% of Total Boost

Total Incentive Token Rewards

Validator A

20 $BGT

25%

.05 ⨉100 + .25 ⨉95 = 28.75 $USDC

Manny

40 $BGT

50%

.5 ⨉ 95 = 47.50 $USDC

Cami

10 $BGT

12.5%

.125 ⨉ 95 = 11.875 $USDC

Jintao

10 $BGT

12.5%

.125 ⨉ 95 = 11.875 $USDC

A validator can change their commission percentage by first queueing the rate to notify users of the upcoming change, waiting `16,382` blocks, and then anyone may activate the new rate for the validator.

Source: https://docs.berachain.com/learn/pol/faqs

## Proof-of-Liquidity Frequently Asked Questions ❓ [​](#proof-of-liquidity-frequently-asked-questions-❓)

### Validator Requirements & Operations [​](#validator-requirements-operations)

#### Can anyone stake $BERA to become a validator? [​](#can-anyone-stake-bera-to-become-a-validator)

While anyone can stake $BERA to try to become a validator in the active set, there are specific staking requirements:

There is a minimum floor of **250,000 $BERA** required to be a validator. There is a maximum cap of **10,000,000 $BERA** for any validator's stake. Only the **top 69 validators** (ordered by $BERA staked) can be in the active validator set. Even if someone stakes above the minimum **250,000 $BERA**, they would still need to have enough stake to be within the **top 69 validators** to be part of the active validator set that can produce blocks.

#### Can validators with no $BGT boosted to them build blocks and earn rewards? [​](#can-validators-with-no-bgt-boosted-to-them-build-blocks-and-earn-rewards)

The ability to build blocks is determined by `$BERA` stake, not `$BGT` boost. As long as a validator has enough `$BERA` staked and is in the active set, they can produce blocks regardless of how much `$BGT` is boosted to them. For every block a validator proposes, that validator receives a reward.

#### Is there a cap for the number of active validators? [​](#is-there-a-cap-for-the-number-of-active-validators)

There will be a mechanism for capping validators to a safe level. The validators within this cap are known as the 'active set.'

### dApps & Reward Vaults [​](#dapps-reward-vaults)

#### Can dApps that don't have a token still participate in PoL? [​](#can-dapps-that-don-t-have-a-token-still-participate-in-pol)

Yes, a fundamental aspect of Proof-of-Liquidity (PoL) is the use of whitelisted Reward Vaults. A protocol only needs to issue a receipt token that can be staked in the protocol's respective whitelisted Reward Vault. The receipt token is different from a native token and can be thought of as a form of bookkeeping token. For example, when a user provides liquidity to a BEX pool, they receive a receipt token in the form of an LP token. That LP token can be staked in a Reward Vault to earn $BGT from emissions directed by validators.

#### Are there restrictions on what kinds of dApps can have whitelisted Reward Vaults? [​](#are-there-restrictions-on-what-kinds-of-dapps-can-have-whitelisted-reward-vaults)

No, any dApp can deploy a Reward Vault and submit it as a governance proposal to have it whitelisted.

#### Are rewards vaults created only by whitelisting governance proposals? [​](#are-rewards-vaults-created-only-by-whitelisting-governance-proposals)

Technically, the creation of rewards vaults is permissionless, but for validators to direct $BGT emissions to those rewards vaults, a governance proposal for whitelisting the rewards vault must pass.

#### Do native dApps have an advantage over non-native dApps that participate in PoL? [​](#do-native-dapps-have-an-advantage-over-non-native-dapps-that-participate-in-pol)

All Reward Vaults are treated equally and their status is determined solely by validators distributing rewards to Reward Vaults. The only exception is that if a Validator does not specify their Reward Allocation, native dApps are set as default Reward Vaults for Reward Allocation for validators.

### Rewards and Emissions [​](#rewards-and-emissions)

#### How much $BGT could any given Reward Vault earn? [​](#how-much-bgt-could-any-given-reward-vault-earn)

The amount of $BGT a given Reward Vault can earn is a function of the following:

1.  How many validators are directing emissions to those vaults
2.  How much $BGT is boosted to the validators directing emissions to those vaults

#### Is the size of the `$BGT` emission linear to the amount of `$BGT` boosted to a validator? [​](#is-the-size-of-the-bgt-emission-linear-to-the-amount-of-bgt-boosted-to-a-validator)

No, the `$BGT` emission is not linear to the amount of `$BGT` boosted to a validator. The emission formula is:

emission\=\[B+max(m,(a+1)(1−1/(1+axb))R)\]

where `B` is the base rate, representing the basic BGT amount that a validator gets for producing a block; `R` is the reward rate, which is the base BGT amount allocated for reward vaults before any boost is applied; `a` is the boost multiplier that determines how much impact boost has on emissions toward reward vaults; `b` is the convexity parameter that controls how quickly boost affects emissions - with high values, validators with low boost get more heavily penalized; `m` is the minimum reward, acting as a floor for emissions to reward vaults - when this is higher, even validators with low boost are guaranteed more emissions.

#### How does Berachain manage hyperinflation of $BGT? [​](#how-does-berachain-manage-hyperinflation-of-bgt)

The inflation of $BGT is equivalent to traditional PoS systems having some percentage of inflation per year. Berachain just takes that PoS inflation and distributes it between a validator and reward vaults.

The end result is that the inflation cadence should effectively mirror an equivalent PoS platform; it's just allocated in a manner that better aligns the interests of validators, protocols, and users.

#### Can only validators vote on or create governance proposals? [​](#can-only-validators-vote-on-or-create-governance-proposals)

Anyone who holds enough $BGT can vote on proposals. Anyone who meets the threshold of 10,000 $BGT can create a proposal.

*파일 경로: pol/participants.md*

Source: https://docs.berachain.com/learn/pol/participants

## Proof-of-Liquidity Participants 👥 [​](#proof-of-liquidity-participants-👥)

This article explores the different players in the Proof-of-Liquidity (PoL) ecosystem and their roles. The following diagram shows a breakdown of the different participants and their priorities/responsibilities:

![PoL Stakeholders](/assets/val-stakeholder-overview.png)

### Validators ✅ [​](#validators-✅)

The active set of validators consists of the top **69 validators** ordered by BERA staked. Being part of the active set entitles validators to earn block rewards, so a key priority for validators is to obtain sufficient `$BERA` stake to be in the active set. Validators earn through three primary means:

1.  Gas fees and priority fees
2.  Collecting incentives provided by protocols for directing BGT rewards to their [Reward Vaults](/learn/pol/rewardvaults)
3.  A base block reward (in `$BGT`) for successfully proposing a block

#### Validator Incentives 💎 [​](#validator-incentives-💎)

When a validator directs `$BGT` emissions to a reward vault, they receive project-supplied [Incentives](/learn/pol/incentives) provided to attract these emissions (thus increasing the attractiveness of depositing into that project). These Incentives can be in the form of the protocol's native token or any other whitelisted ERC20 token.

Successful validators in PoL optimize for:

*   Securing `$BGT` delegation to increase their block rewards
*   Efficiently exchanging `$BGT` block rewards for protocol incentives
*   Distributing value back to their `$BGT` delegators

### BGT Holders & Farmers 🥕 [​](#bgt-holders-farmers-🥕)

BGT holders play a crucial role in:

*   Voting on governance proposals
*   Influencing economic incentives through `$BGT` delegation
*   Supplying ecosystem liquidity in reward vaults to earn `$BGT`

TIP

$BGT that is delegated to validators is not subject to slashing. Only validators' $BERA stakes can be slashed.

#### Earning and Delegating $BGT ⬇️ [​](#earning-and-delegating-bgt-⬇️)

Users can earn `$BGT` by staking PoL-eligible receipt tokens in reward vaults. These receipt tokens are generated by performing actions that benefit the Berachain ecosystem, such as providing liquidity to a BEX pool.

When selecting a validator to delegate `$BGT` to, users typically consider:

*   Which reward vaults validators direct emissions to
*   Validator commission rates and incentive distribution strategies
*   Validator uptime and performance

The primary goal is to earn as many Incentives as possible through delegation.

### Ecosystem Projects 🧸 [​](#ecosystem-projects-🧸)

Projects participate in PoL by:

1.  Creating a reward vault through the factory contract
2.  Submitting a governance proposal to whitelist the vault
3.  Supplying incentive tokens and managing rates in their vault

The [Incentives marketplace](/learn/pol/incentives) allows protocols to bid for validators' emissions using whitelisted tokens, creating alignment between all stakeholders to increase the overall value of the network. Projects must also gain the favor of `$BGT` holders to enter into the PoL system.

## 📁 pol / Reward Vaults

*파일 경로: pol/rewardvaults.md*

Source: https://docs.berachain.com/learn/pol/rewardvaults

## Reward Vaults [​](#reward-vaults)

Reward Vaults are smart contracts in which users can stake their Proof-of-Liquidity (PoL) eligible assets to receive `$BGT` rewards. Reward Vaults are the only way anyone can earn `$BGT` rewards, and therefore serve the important function of gating entry into the PoL ecosystem.

Reward Vaults are key infrastructure that allows protocols to leverage PoL, enabling teams to incentivize users' actions in exchange for `$BGT`. A protocol can have multiple Reward Vaults, each with its own PoL-eligible asset to be staked. For example, BEX can have multiple pools earning `$BGT`, each with its own Reward Vault and respective PoL-eligible asset.

It should be noted that only Whitelisted Reward Vaults are elligible to receive `$BGT` emissions from Validators.

### User Interactions [​](#user-interactions)

#### Staking With A Reward Vault [​](#staking-with-a-reward-vault)

![Berachain Reward Vault Staking BEX](/assets/berachain-reward-vault-staking-bex.png)

To receive `$BGT`, a user must stake the PoL-eligible asset in its Reward Vault. The protocol that deployed the Reward Vault decides how users acquire the PoL-eligible asset to stake. The idea is that protocols would leverage this to attract liquidity or stimulate activity, and in return award users with the asset they can stake in their vault.

1.  The user takes some action that results in receiving a PoL-eligible asset, generally referred to as a receipt token.
2.  The user stakes the PoL-eligible asset in the corresponding vault.
3.  The user earns a portion of all the BGT emitted to that vault.

#### Earning BGT [​](#earning-bgt)

The amount of `$BGT` rewards a user earns from a Reward Vault is a function of:

1.  The user's share of total assets staked in the Reward Vault
2.  The amount of `$BGT` rewards emitted to the Reward Vault

After staking assets in a Reward Vault, users are free to claim their earned rewards, add to their deposits, or withdraw their assets whenever they wish.

`$BGT` farming with Reward Vaults is meant to resemble familiar DeFi actions, providing a low barrier to entry.

### $BGT Flow [​](#bgt-flow)

When a validator is chosen to propose a block, they direct a portion of their `$BGT` emissions to specific Reward Vaults of their choice. To learn more about how `$BGT` is calculated in block production, check out the docs on [emissions](/learn/pol/bgtmath).

### Incentives [​](#incentives)

To understand why validators would choose to emit `$BGT` to one Reward Vault over another, refer to [Incentives](/learn/pol/incentives) in PoL, which discusses how protocols can influence validator behavior with economic incentives.

### Vault Creation [​](#vault-creation)

New Reward Vaults can be created permissionlessly at [https://hub.berachain.com/vaults/create](https://hub.berachain.com/vaults/create).

Protocols creating Reward Vaults must additionally [whitelist their vaults](/learn/governance/rewardvault) through `$BGT` governance to be eligible to receive emissions from validators.

### Calculating `$BGT` APR [​](#calculating-bgt-apr)

As a user, if I want to manually verify the BGT APR for a given Reward Vault, the following information is available on chain to do so. The value calculated corresponds to the light blue `BGT APR` value found on the Hub frontend.

![BGT APR Example](/assets/bgt-apr-example.CNgn6keI.png)

The [RewardVault](/developers/contracts/reward-vault) APR is determined by several factors. The components of this APR calculation include:

*   `rewardRate` - The BGT amount added to Reward Vault Staker's total claims per second
*   `periodFinish` - The timestamp when the `rewardRate` expires
*   `stakeToken` - The token you stake into the Reward Vault
*   `totalSupply` - The total amount of `stakeToken` staked in the Reward Vault
*   Price of `$BGT` (`$BERA`) - The assumption is made the price of `$BGT` is equivalent the `$BERA` price
*   Price of Stake Token

INFO

If the `periodFinish` timestamp has elapsed no rewards are being emitted. As a result, the `$BGT` APR is 0%.

The units of `rewardRate` is denominated as `$BGT per second`. The above pieces of data allow us to calculate the APR on the Reward Vault in the following way:

The units of `rewardRate` is denominated as `$BGT per second`. The above pieces of data allow us to calculate the APR on the Reward Vault in the following way:

APR\=rewardRate×secondsPerYear×priceOfBGTtotalSupply×priceOfStakeToken

This formula provides the current rate that the Reward Vault is crediting depositors with `$BGT`.

#### Example [​](#example)

As a concrete example of the above formula, a reward vault with the following values can be used:

Parameter

TIP

The `rewardRate` returned is in gwei and includes an extra precision factor of `1e18`, so is effectively in wei. Normalizing it requires dividing by `1e36`.

Using the formula above:

APR\=0.27249052710368116×31536000×7.8598.6269409470011×223845.58∴APR\=0.500204\=50.02%

## 📁 pol/tokens / $BERA

*파일 경로: pol/tokens/bera.md*

Source: https://docs.berachain.com/learn/pol/tokens/bera

## $BERA [​](#bera)

`$WBERA`: [0x6969696969696969696969696969696969696969](https://berascan.com/address/0x6969696969696969696969696969696969696969)

`$BERA` serves as the native gas and staking token of Berachain, the first blockchain powered by Proof-of-Liquidity.

### Role of BERA [​](#role-of-bera)

The `$BERA` token serves two main purposes on the Berachain network:

#### Transaction Fees [​](#transaction-fees)

`$BERA` is used to pay for transactions on the Berachain network (hence its designation as the "gas token"). Tokens used for transaction fees are burned, removing them from the circulating supply.

#### Validator Staking [​](#validator-staking)

Validators stake `$BERA` to operate a validator. Within the active set, the more `$BERA` a validator has staked, the more frequently they are chosen to propose blocks. A validator's probability of block production is directly proportional to their share of the total staked `$BERA`. The economic value of all staked `$BERA` tokens forms the economic security of the chain, with [$BGT](/learn/pol/tokens/bgt) dynamics controlling its inflation.

To learn more about how `$BERA` staking affects block production and emissions, see [Block Production](/learn/pol/bgtmath).

## 📁 pol/tokens / $BGT

*파일 경로: pol/tokens/bgt.md*

## $BGT [​](#bgt)

[0x656b95E550C07a9ffe548bd4085c72418Ceb1dba](https://berascan.com/address/0x656b95E550C07a9ffe548bd4085c72418Ceb1dba)

Proof-of-Stake blockchains typically have a single token that is used to secure the network through staking and is additionally used for gas, governance, and economic incentives. `$BGT` and the two-token model bifurcate the first two functions from the latter two.

Through Berachain's two-token Proof-of-Liquidity (PoL) model, the functions of governance and economic incentives (emissions & block rewards) are separated into their own token - `$BGT` (Bera Governance Token). `$BGT` is non-transferrable and can only be acquired by engaging in productive activities within the Berachain ecosystem.

### Earning `$BGT` [​](#earning-bgt)

`$BGT` is earned by performing certain actions in dApps with whitelisted [Reward Vaults](/learn/pol/rewardvaults). Most of the time, this is related to providing liquidity, but it is not limited to this. Reward Vault deposits correspond to some form of productive activity on Berachain.

The typical flow is for users to supply liquidity and receive a receipt token for that activity, which they can then stake in reward vaults to earn `$BGT`. Some examples include:

*   Depositing liquidity in the native BEX for an LP pair whitelisted to earn `$BGT` emissions
*   Supplying assets to a lending market and staking the interest-bearing receipt tokens in a reward vault

Users can see available earning options at [https://hub.berachain.com/pools](https://hub.berachain.com/pools).

Users can claim accumulated `$BGT` from Berahub.

### What can you do with $BGT? [​](#what-can-you-do-with-bgt)

#### Governance [​](#governance)

`$BGT` is used to vote on governance proposals. `$BGT` holders are responsible for a wide variety of ecosystem decisions (see [Governance](/learn/governance)).

`$BGT` holders can either vote on proposals themselves or delegate their voting power to another address. This governance delegation operates independently of boosting validators for controlling their `$BGT` emissions.

#### Earn [​](#earn)

##### Boost A Validator For Incentives [​](#boost-a-validator-for-incentives)

Users can select validators to "boost" with their `$BGT`, increasing the validator's [reward emission](/learn/pol/bgtmath). The amount of [Incentives](/learn/pol/incentives) earned is determined by validators' aggregate boost. These incentives are returned to the `$BGT` holders who boosted the validator.

##### dApp Fees [​](#dapp-fees)

Users who are boosting validators with their `$BGT` earn a share of Berachain core dApp fees, namely fees from Berachain BEX and Berachain $HONEY Swap. This is done via the [`FeeCollector`](/developers/contracts/fee-collector) contract.

At a high level, `FeeCollector` auctions fees collected from dApps for `$WBERA` and then distributes them pro rata to `$BGT` holders who have boosted validators.

#### Redeem $BGT For $BERA [​](#redeem-bgt-for-bera)

`$BGT` can be redeemed (burned) 1:1 for `$BERA`. This is a one-way function, and `$BERA` cannot be converted into `$BGT`. This limits the ability to earn the chain's economic incentives solely to `$BGT` holders.

## $HONEY [​](#honey)

[0xFCBD14DC51f0A4d49d5E53C2E0950e0bC26d0Dce](https://berascan.com/address/0xFCBD14DC51f0A4d49d5E53C2E0950e0bC26d0Dce)

`$HONEY` is Berachain's native stablecoin, designed to provide a stable and reliable means of exchange within the Berachain ecosystem and beyond. `$HONEY` is fully collateralized and soft-pegged to the US Dollar.

### How to Get $HONEY [​](#how-to-get-honey)

`$HONEY` can be minted by depositing whitelisted collateral into a vault and minting `$HONEY` against that collateral through the [HoneySwap dApp](https://honey.berachain.com/). The minting rates of `$HONEY` are configurable by `$BGT` governance for each different collateral asset.

Alternatively, `$HONEY` can be obtained by swapping from other assets on [BEX](/learn/dapps/bex) or another decentralized exchange.

#### Collateral Assets [​](#collateral-assets)

The initial collateral options will be `$USDC` and `$BYUSD` (`$pyUSD`). New assets used to mint `$HONEY` can be added through governance.

### How is $HONEY Used? [​](#how-is-honey-used)

`$HONEY` shares the same uses as other stablecoins, such as for payments/remittances and as a hedge against market volatility. `$HONEY` can also be used within the Berachain DeFi ecosystem.

### $HONEY Architecture [​](#honey-architecture)

A flow diagram of the `$HONEY` minting process and associated contracts is shown below: ![HONEY Minting](/assets/honey-minting.png)

#### $HONEY Vaults [​](#honey-vaults)

`$HONEY` is minted by depositing eligible collateral into specialized vault contracts. Each vault is specific to a particular collateral type, with its own unique mint and redemption rate.

In the top flow of the above example, the user deposits `$USDC` to mint `$HONEY`. Only the `$USDC` vault is interacted with, not the `$pyUSD` vault.

#### HoneyFactory [​](#honeyfactory)

At the heart of the `$HONEY` minting process is the HoneyFactory contract. This contract acts as a central hub, connecting all the different `$HONEY` Vaults and is responsible for minting new `$HONEY` tokens.

As shown in the diagram, users' deposits are routed through the `HoneyFactory` contract to the appropriate vault. The `HoneyFactory` custodies the shares minted by the vault (corresponding to users' deposits) and mints `$HONEY` tokens to the user.

### Depegging and Basket Mode [​](#depegging-and-basket-mode)

Basket Mode is a safety mechanism that activates when collateral assets become unstable. It affects both minting and redemption of `$HONEY` in specific ways:

**Redemption:**

*   When ANY collateral asset depegs, Basket Mode automatically activates
*   In this mode, users can't choose which asset they redeem their `$HONEY` for
*   Instead, users redeem for a proportional share of ALL collateral assets in the basket
*   For example, if you redeem 1 `$HONEY` token with Basket Mode active, you'll get:
    *   Some `$USDC` based on its relative proportion as collateral
    *   Some `$pyUSD` based on its relative proportion as collateral

**Minting:**

*   Basket Mode for minting is considered an edge case that only occurs if ALL collateral assets are either depegged or blacklisted. Depegged assets cannot be used to mint `$HONEY`
*   In this situation, to mint `$HONEY`, users must provide proportional amounts of all collateral assets in the basket, rather than choosing a single asset
*   If one asset is depegged, you can mint only with the other asset

### Fees [​](#fees)

Fees collected from minting and redeeming `$HONEY` are distributed to `$BGT` holders. Fees are determined based on the mint and redemption rates of each vault. For example, if the mint rate of the USDC vault is 0.999 (1 `$USDC` for 0.999 HONEY),thenafeeof0.001or0.1USDC\` deposited.

#### Example [​](#example)

Let's consider an example with the following parameters:

*   User wishes to deposit `1,000 $USDC`
*   Mint rate for `$USDC` is set at `0.999` (`99.9%`)

Here's how the minting process would work:

1.  The user deposits `1,000 $USDC` into the HoneyFactory contract
2.  The HoneyFactory calculates the amount of `$HONEY` to mint:

*   `$HONEY` to mint = Vault shares × Mint rate
*   `$HONEY` to mint = `1,000` × `0.999` = `999 $HONEY`

3.  The HoneyFactory transfers 999 `$USDC` to the USDC vault and receives 999 vault shares in return

*   Fee shares = Vault shares - `$HONEY` to mint
*   Fee shares = `1,000 - 999 = 1 share`
*   The HoneyFactory transfers 1 vault share to the fee receiver

[Learn more about BERA's role in the network](/learn/pol/tokens/bera).

### Distribution and Allocation [​](#distribution-and-allocation)

The total genesis supply of 500 million `$BERA` is allocated across five categories:

![BERA Allocation](/assets/bera-allocation.png)

##### Initial Core Contributors - 84,000,000 (16.8%) [​](#initial-core-contributors-84-000-000-16-8)

Tokens are distributed to advisors and members of Big Bera Labs, the core contributors to the Berachain blockchain.

##### Investors - 171,500,000 (34.3%) [​](#investors-171-500-000-34-3)

Tokens are distributed to Berachain's Seed, Series A, and Series B investors.

##### Community Allocations [​](#community-allocations)

Berachain's growth to date has been largely driven by an unparalleled community and a massive developer ecosystem leveraging Proof of Liquidity to power the next generation of applications. The community allocation (**244,500,000** `$BERA` total, or 48.9% of supply) is broken down across three key areas:

###### Airdrop - 79,000,000 (15.8%) [​](#airdrop-79-000-000-15-8)

15.8% of Berachain's token supply will be distributed through airdrops, recognizing various parties within the Berachain ecosystem, including testnet users, Berachain NFT holders, ecosystem NFT holders, social supporters, ecosystem dApps, community builders, and more. For more information on the airdrop breakdown, please visit the [Blog](https://blog.berachain.com/blog/berachain-airdrop-overview).

###### Future Community Initiatives - 65,500,000 (13.1%) [​](#future-community-initiatives-65-500-000-13-1)

13.1% of Berachain's token supply will be dedicated to applications, developers, and users through incentive programs, grants, and more, with input from the community itself via Snapshots, RFPs, etc.

###### Ecosystem & R&D - 100,000,000 (20%) [​](#ecosystem-r-d-100-000-000-20)

20% of Berachain's token supply will be used to support ecosystem development, R&D, growth initiatives, and the operations of the Berachain Foundation. This will largely focus on programs for developers and builders (see [Boyco](https://boyco.berachain.com/)), node operator delegations, and evolutions of Proof-of-Liquidity and BeaconKit.

*At launch, 9.5% of `$BERA` supply is unlocked from this bucket for ecosystem growth, developer tooling/infrastructure, liquidity provisioning, and more.*

### Token Release Schedule [​](#token-release-schedule)

All parties follow an identical vesting schedule:

*   Initial Unlock: After a one-year cliff, 1/6th of allocated tokens are unlocked
*   Linear Vesting: The remaining 5/6ths of tokens vest linearly over the subsequent 24 months

## Borrow

[](#borrow)

BorrowersLiquidity Pools

Borrowing tokens from the Aave Protocol allows users to access liquidity by using their supplied tokens as collateral, unlocking capital without selling their assets. However, borrowers face liquidation risk if the value of their collateral falls below the required threshold. Interest rates are determined dynamically, influenced by protocol factors and governance decisions, and can change over time based on community input. Interest accrues based on the utilisation rate, which reflects the percentage of supplied liquidity that is borrowed. Higher utilisation rates lead to higher interest rates, adjusting with demand. Each reserve has specific parameters designed to incentivize both borrowers and suppliers.

To maintain a healthy ratio and avoid liquidation risk, borrowers should actively monitor their collateralization level, keeping their health factor in check, to assure their borrow positions remain overcollateralised even as market conditions change or interest accrues.

## Flash Loans

[](#flash-loans)

Liquidity PoolFlash LoanReceiver

Flash Loans are special transactions that allow users to borrow an asset for a single block, provided they repay the borrowed amount and a fee within that same block time. Sometimes these actions are also referred to as ‚ÄúOne Block Borrows.‚Äù Flash Loans do not require any collateral upfront. There is no direct real-world analogy to Flash Loans, so it requires some basic understanding of how state is managed within blocks in blockchains.

There are tools allowing users to utilise Flash Loans to access liquidity in the background for advanced features such as repay with collateral, collateral switch, and more.

Example interfaces that integrate Flash Loans are [DeFi Saver](https://defisaver.com), [Instadapp](https://instadapp.io/), and [Furucombo](https://furucombo.app/).

Flash Loans let users borrow from a pool‚Äôs reserves (if borrowing is enabled) for one transaction, provided they repay the amount taken plus a fee (0.07% in Aave V2, 0.05% in Aave V3) or open a borrow position within the same transaction.

Due to the technical knowledge required to execute a Flash Loan, the feature is designed for developers. To do a Flash Loan, users will need to build a contract that requests a Flash Loan. For more information on integrating flash loans, see the [developers' guide](/docs/developers/flash-loans).

*ÌååÏùº Í≤ΩÎ°ú: concepts/liquidations.md*

Source: https://aave.com/docs/concepts/liquidations

## Liquidations

[](#liquidations)

The **health factor** is a critical metric within the Aave Protocol that measures the safety of a borrow position. It is calculated as:

Health Factor = (Total Collateral Value \* Weighted Average Liquidation Threshold) / Total Borrow Value

The health factor measures a borrow position‚Äôs stability. A health factor below 1 risks liquidation. The liquidation threshold, set by Aave Governance for each asset, determines the maximum percentage of value that can be borrowed against the asset. For example, if a user supplies $10,000 in ETH with an 80% liquidation threshold and borrows $6,000 in GHO, the health factor would be 1.333.

A health factor above 1 represents a position that is above the liquidation threshold. Regular monitoring is essential, as the health factor fluctuates based on both the value of collateral and borrowed assets. To improve the health factor, users can either supply more collateral or repay part of the borrow position. The health factor is directly tied to collateral value. If the value rises, the health factor improves; if it falls, the health factor declines, increasing the risk of liquidation.

However, there is no universally "safe" health factor. The health factor depends on the volatility and correlation of the assets. Lower health factors may be acceptable, for example, with correlated assets, such as stablecoins or assets closely tied to ETH.

Liquidation happens when a borrower's health factor drops below 1, meaning their collateral is insufficient to cover the borrowed amount. This can occur when the value of collateral decreases or the borrowing amount is increased. When a liquidation occurs, up to 50% of the borrower's debt is repaid by a liquidator. A liquidation fee is also levied against the borrower's collateral. Liquidations are permissionless, meaning any participant within the network can initiate the liquidation of an eligible borrow position.

Liquidations are highly competitive, requiring a deep understanding of the protocol and technical proficiency. Liquidators closely monitor borrow positions, react swiftly to market changes, and prioritise liquidation transactions to be the first to execute the liquidation.

Source: https://aave.com/docs/concepts/liquidity-protocol

## Liquidity Protocol

[](#liquidity-protocol)

A **liquidity protocol** is a decentralised system of smart contracts that facilitates the transfer of digital assets. As a leading liquidity protocol that operates on a supply and borrow model, Aave enables users to supply their assets to liquidity pools and, in return, allows other participants to borrow from those pools using their own collateral. The protocol operates across multiple blockchain networks, making it highly accessible to users across different ecosystems.

One of the key features of a decentralised liquidity protocol is its non-custodial nature, meaning users maintain control over their assets at all times. Interaction with the protocol happens through self-custodial wallets, allowing users to supply or borrow funds directly, without relying on intermediaries. All of this is managed through publicly accessible and permissionless smart contracts, which execute and verify transactions based on predefined conditions, such as collateral ratios and market parameters, providing a transparent and trustless experience.

Aave is governed by AAVE token holders. This decentralised governance model further enhances the protocol‚Äôs adaptability and accessibility. Governance token holders can propose, vote, and implement changes to the protocol, including adjusting interest rates and collateral requirements as well as other key parameters that impact both borrowers and suppliers. This decentralised management structure means that the protocol can evolve in response to the needs of its community without requiring centralised control.

As a decentralised finance (DeFi) platform, Aave includes a range of features, from its native GHO stablecoin to periphery contracts that simplify complex actions like asset swaps and repayments. The flexibility of a liquidity protocol like Aave highlights the potential of DeFi to offer more open, transparent, and equitable financial services to anyone with access to a blockchain network.

## Repay

[](#repay)

SuppliersLiquidity Pools

Repaying borrowed tokens in the Aave Protocol is an important step for managing borrow positions. Borrowers can repay using the same tokens they borrowed, or repay with aTokens (collateral tokens) of the same underlying token. In addition, there are [periphery contracts](https://github.com/aave/aave-v3-periphery) available that simplify the process by allowing repayment with other tokens, such as other collateral assets, without the need to manually convert them beforehand. This flexibility makes it easier for borrowers to manage and close their positions when needed.

Repayment increases the collateralisation ratio, ensuring adequate collateralization and preventing liquidation. By boosting the collateral relative to what is borrowed, repayment prevents assets from being liquidated and allows borrowers to safely withdraw part of their collateral.

*ÌååÏùº Í≤ΩÎ°ú: concepts/risks.md*

Source: https://aave.com/docs/concepts/risks

## Risks

[](#risks)

The Aave Protocol offers decentralised access to liquidity but is not without risks. Robust risk management measures, including smart contract audits and governance frameworks, are in place to help mitigate risks. Below is an overview of key risks and mitigation efforts.

### Smart Contract Risk

[](#smart-contract-risk)

Smart contracts can contain software bugs or other vulnerabilities within the protocol code and the underlying reserve tokens. To mitigate these risks, Aave‚Äôs code is publicly available for audit and has undergone multiple external third-party professional audits. Any proposed changes to the protocol code are thoroughly reviewed and approved prior to implementation by the Aave community. Additionally, the protocol runs a continuous bug bounty program to incentivize external developers to identify and report any issues they may find so they can be fixed.

### Oracle Risk

[](#oracle-risk)

Aave relies on third-party oracles for price feeds and external data, such as redemption ratios for liquid staking tokens. This reliance introduces potential risks such as incorrect valuations if an oracle fails or is compromised. To reduce this risk, Aave uses decentralised oracles like Chainlink, which provide tamper-resistant data feeds, greater reliability, and security measures.

### Collateral Risk

[](#collateral-risk)

The Aave DAO also engages risk service providers who track collateral performance and market stability. The value and liquidity of assets used as collateral can fluctuate, leading to the risk of under collateralisation or bad debt. Aave mitigates these risks by setting key risk parameters such as loan-to-value (LTV) ratios and liquidation thresholds. These parameters are continuously monitored by risk service providers and can be adjusted by Aave governance to respond to market conditions.

### Network / Bridge Risk

[](#network-bridge-risk)

Aave operates across multiple blockchain networks and bridges, each with potential risks such as congestion, censorship, or security vulnerabilities. To address these types of risks, Aave Governance has a robust network onboarding framework that thoroughly vets new networks and bridges before they are integrated into the protocol. Community oversight during the governance process is an important step to validate adoption of secure and reliable systems, minimising risk.

For additional information on Aave Protocol risk management, see [Security & Audits](https://aave.com/security).

## Supply

[](#supply)

SuppliersLiquidity Pools

Supplying tokens to the Aave Protocol allows users to earn interest on their digital assets and utilise supplied tokens as collateral. When tokens are supplied, they are transferred to the Aave liquidity pool, a system of smart contracts that facilitates overcollateralised borrowing of tokens. In Aave, supplied tokens automatically accrue interest based on the current market supply rate. As the balance of supplied tokens increases, interest is accrued dynamically, reflecting the current rate allocated to suppliers.

Interest rates for supplied tokens are determined by the borrow utilisation rate, which measures the proportion of assets currently borrowed against the total supplied in the pool, and by governance parameters that can be adjusted through community decisions. These parameters, including collateralisation requirements and interest rates for suppliers and borrowers, are influenced by onchain inputs such as token balances, oracle prices, and the borrow utilisation ratio. As liquidity is supplied, borrowed, repaid, or withdrawn from the pool, the interest rates are updated accordingly.

## Withdraw

[](#withdraw)

BorrowersLiquidity Pools

Aave Protocol allows suppliers to withdraw their supplied tokens, including accrued interest, as long as there is sufficient unborrowed liquidity in the reserve. The withdrawal amount is limited by the available underlying assets, and that the user‚Äôs ability to maintain a sufficient collateral ratio for their borrow position. Periphery contracts with features such as withdraw and switch, allow users to redeem their supplied liquidity in a different token, providing more options for efficient asset management.

When withdrawing with an active borrow position, it‚Äôs crucial to maintain a healthy collateralisation ratio to avoid liquidation. Reducing collateral can lower the health factor, increasing the risk of liquidation. To remain safe, after the withdrawal, the account must stay above the liquidation threshold parameters. Therefore, withdrawals require careful management and consideration of the overall borrow positions to avoid liquidation.

SuppliersBorrowersWalletsDappsVariable ratesInterest bearing tokensFlash loansReserve liquidity pools

### Features

[](#features)

The Aave Protocol is a decentralised non-custodial liquidity protocol where users can participate as suppliers, borrowers, or liquidators. Suppliers provide liquidity to a market and can earn interest on the crypto assets provided, while borrowers are able to borrow in an overcollateralized fashion. Borrowers can also engage in one-block borrow transactions (‚Äùflash loans‚Äù), which do not require overcollateralization.

V3 of the Aave Protocol augments the core concepts of the Aave Protocol (aTokens, instant liquidity, credit delegation, etc.) with new features in the following areas.

#### Capital Efficiency

[](#features-capital-efficiency)

V3 allows users to optimise their assets supplied to the Aave Protocol in terms of yield generation and borrowing power.

#### Efficiency Mode (E-Mode)

[](#features-efficiency-mode-e-mode)

The High Efficiency Mode, or eMode, allows borrowers to extract the highest borrowing power out of their collateral when supplied and borrowed assets are correlated in price, particularly when both are derivatives of the same underlying asset (e.g., stablecoins pegged to USD).

This can enable a wave of new use cases such as high leverage forex trading, highly efficient yield farming (for example, deposit ETH staking derivatives to borrow ETH), and diversified risk management.

#### Isolation Mode

[](#features-isolation-mode)

New assets can be listed as isolated in Aave Protocol V3. Borrowers supplying an isolated asset as collateral cannot supply other assets as collateral (though they can still supply to capture yield). Borrowers using an isolated collateral can only borrow stablecoins that have been configured by Aave governance to be borrowable in isolation mode, up to a specified debt ceiling.

View debt ceiling and borrowable in isolation mode parameters on the [parameter dashboard](/docs/resources/parameters).

NormalUser suppliesNon-isolated tokenCan Borrow:Any AssetCan Supply:Any AssetIsolation ModeUser suppliesisolated tokenCan borrow:TetherUSDTDaiDAIUSD CoinUSDCCan Supply:Any Asset

#### Siloed Borrowing

[](#features-siloed-borrowing)

Siloed Borrowing allows certain assets to be treated as isolated within the protocol. Borrowers using these assets as collateral can only borrow stablecoins configured for siloed assets, with strict borrowing limits defined by the Aave governance. This structure reduces the systemic risk for assets that are highly volatile or less liquid by limiting their borrowing capacities and containing the exposure to siloed assets.

View debt ceiling and siloed assets parameters on the [parameter dashboard](/docs/resources/parameters).

#### Portals

[](#features-portals)

This feature allows the flow of liquidity between Aave V3 markets across different networks. Protocol V3 allows governance-approved bridges to burn aTokens on the source network while instantly minting them on the destination network. The underlying assets can then be supplied to Aave on the destination network in a deferred manner, by passing them to the pool after they have been moved through a bridge.

Aave V3 provides a new system role - BRIDGE - granting permission to leverage the Portal feature. Only addresses with the BRIDGE\_ROLE can move the supplied liquidity in Aave V3.

Aave Governance holds the ability to grant BRIDGE\_ROLE to any cross-chain protocol.

This can help bridging protocols like Connext, Hop Protocol, Anyswap, xPollinate, and novel solutions specifically built to leverage Portal, tap into Aave Protocol liquidity to facilitate seamless cross-chain interactions.

In order to support Portal, the following three additional features are required by the protocol:

*   Mint Unbacked Tokens: Allows addresses with BRIDGE role permission to mint unbacked aTokens to the onBehalfOf address.
    
*   Back Unbacked Tokens: Allows contracts with BRIDGE role permission to back the currently unbacked aTokens with the amount of underlying asset and pay a fee.
    
*   Whitelist Bridges: Allows the Bridge Role Admin to add/remove addresses for BRIDGE\_ROLE.
    

### Integrations

[](#integrations)

#### Live Data

[](#integrations-live-data)

For reliable live data integrations, the recommended approach is to query directly from protocol [view contracts](/docs/developers/smart-contracts/view-contracts) such as the UiPoolDataProvider. This enables you to access all reserve information and user positions efficiently.

To simplify the process of querying Aave Protocol data through a blockchain RPC, you can use the Aave Utilities SDK, which is an extension of ethers v5. It streamlines data fetching and formatting, making it easier to interact with the protocol.

You can learn how to fetch data by following the instructions in the [Fetch Data](https://github.com/aave/aave-utilities#data-methods-setup) section of the SDK documentation. After fetching the data, you might need to format it for your application; the [Format Data](https://github.com/aave/aave-utilities#formatreserves) guide provides detailed instructions on how to format reserves and other relevant data structures. For a practical implementation example, you can refer to this [code sample](https://github.com/WeAreNewt/config.fyi/blob/master/pages/api/aave.ts), which demonstrates how to use the Aave Utilities SDK in a demo NextJS application.

#### Historical Data

[](#integrations-historical-data)

If you're interested in historical data for parameters, rates, and balances, you can query contract events directly or use indexed data sources. A comprehensive breakdown of all core protocol events can be found in the documentation.

The Aave Protocol subgraphs are an example of an indexed data source that maps contract events to a GraphQL endpoint, allowing for efficient querying of historical data. For example, you can explore [queries of an address's transaction history](https://github.com/aave/protocol-subgraphs?tab=readme-ov-file#user-transaction-history) using these subgraphs.

#### Smart Contracts

[](#integrations-smart-contracts)

For detailed information on interacting with the protocol's smart contracts, please refer to the [Pool Methods](/docs/developers/smart-contracts/pool) documentation. Additionally, the [Testing & Debugging](/docs/developers/testing-and-debugging) guides offer valuable insights into developing and troubleshooting smart contract integrations.

## üìÅ developers / Credit Delegation | Aave Protocol Documentation

*ÌååÏùº Í≤ΩÎ°ú: developers/credit_delegation.md*

Source: https://aave.com/docs/developers/credit-delegation

## Credit Delegation

[](#credit-delegation)

Credit delegation allows a supplier to contribute liquidity to the Aave protocol to earn interest, and delegate borrowing power (i.e. their credit) to other users. The enforcement of the borrow position and its terms are agreed upon between the supplier and borrowers, which can be either offchain via legal agreements or onchain via smart contracts.

This enables:

*   The supplier (aka delegator) to earn extra yield on top of the yield they already earn from the protocol.
    
*   The borrowers (aka delegatees) to access uncollateralized liquidity.
    

Borrow by *delegatee* must be consistent with *delegator* eMode category. For eg. if a delegator eMode category is STABLECOINS, then

*   Delegator can only borrow STABLECOINS eMode category asset.
    
*   In case *delegator* approve credit to *delegatee* for non STABLECOINScategory (for eg. weth), then borrow would revert.
    

The *delegatee* cannot abuse credit approval to liquidate *delegator* i.e. if the borrow puts *delegator's* position in HF < HEALTH\_FACTOR\_LIQUIDATION\_THRESHOLD, then borrow will fail.

### Approving the delegation

[](#approving-the-delegation)

The approveDelegation or delegationWithSig function on the [VariableDebtToken](/docs/developers/smart-contracts/tokenization#variabledebttoken) contract must be called by the supplier (delegator), approving the borrower (delegatee) a certain amount.

This is done for each debt token that needs to be delegated.

The delegator does not need to already have supplied funds in the protocol to approveDelegation. However, **before** the delegatee executes borrow, there must be sufficient collateral supplied by delegator in the protocol.

### Borrowing the credit

[](#borrowing-the-credit)

The borrower (delegatee) calls the borrow function on the [Pool](/docs/developers/smart-contracts/pool), using the supplier's (delegator's) address in final parameter onBehalfOf.

The borrower's available credit is reduced by the borrowed amount.

### Repaying the credit

[](#repaying-the-credit)

Anyone can repay the borrow position *OnBehalf* of the user, by calling one of the following [Pool](/docs/developers/smart-contracts/pool) functions - repay or repayWithPermit. The supplier (aka creditor) can also use the repayWithATokens function to repay a borrow position with their *aTokens* of the underlying asset in the same pool.

## Flash Loans

[](#flash-loans)

Flash Loans are special transactions that allow the borrowing of an asset, as long as the borrowed amount (and a fee) is returned before the end of the transaction (also called One Block Borrows). These transactions do not require a user to supply collateral prior to engaging in the transaction. There is no real world analogy to Flash Loans, so it requires some basic understanding of how state is managed within blocks in blockchains.

Flash Loans are an advanced concept aimed at developers. You must have a good understanding of EVM, programming, and smart contracts to be able to use this feature.

### Overview

[](#overview)

Flash-loan allows users to access liquidity of the pool (only for reserves for which borrow is enabled) for one transaction as long as the amount taken plus fee is returned or (if allowed) debt position is opened by the end of the transaction.

Aave V3 offers two options for flash loans:

*   [flashLoan()](/docs/developers/smart-contracts/pool#flashloan): Allows borrower to access liquidity of ***multiple reserves*** in single *flashLoan* transaction. The borrower also has an option to open variable rate borrow position backed by supplied collateral or credit delegation in this case.  
    NOTE: *flash loan fee* is waived for approved flashBorrowers (managed by [ACLManager](/docs/developers/smart-contracts/acl-manager))
    
*   [flashLoanSimple()](/docs/developers/smart-contracts/pool#flashloansimple): Allows borrower to access liquidity of *single reserve* for the transaction. In this case flash loan fee is not waived nor can borrower open any debt position at the end of the transaction. This method is gas efficient for those trying take advantage of simple flash loan with single reserve asset.
    

#### Execution Flow

[](#overview-execution-flow)

For developers, a helpful mental model to consider when developing your solution:

1.  Your contract calls the [Pool](/docs/developers/smart-contracts/pool) contract, requesting a Flash Loan of a certain amount(s) of reserve(s) using [flashLoanSimple()](/docs/developers/smart-contracts/pool#flashloansimple) or [flashLoan()](/docs/developers/smart-contracts/pool#flashloan).
    
2.  After some sanity checks, the [Pool](/docs/developers/smart-contracts/pool) transfers the requested amounts of the reserves to your contract, then calls executeOperation() on receiver contract .
    
3.  Your contract, now holding the flash loaned amount(s), executes any arbitrary operation in its code.
    
    *   If you are performing a **flashLoanSimple**, then when your code has finished, you approve Pool for flash loaned amount + fee.
        
    *   If you are performing **flashLoan,** then for all the reserves either depending on interestRateMode passed for the asset, either the Pool must be approved for flash loaned amount + fee or must or sufficient collateral or credit delegation should be available to open debt position.
        
    *   If the amount owed is not available (due to a lack of balance or approval or insufficient collateral for debt), then the transaction is reverted.
        
    
4.  All of the above happens in 1 transaction (hence in a single ethereum block).
    

#### Applications of Flash Loans

[](#overview-applications-of-flash-loans)

Aave Flash Loans are already used with Aave V3 for liquidity switch feature. Other examples in the wild include:

*   Arbitrage between assets, without needing to have the principal amount to execute the arbitrage.
    
*   Liquidating borrow positions, without having to repay the debt of the positions and using discounted collateral claimed to payoff flashLoan amount + fee.
    

#### Flash loan fee

[](#overview-flash-loan-fee)

The flash loan fee is initialized at deployment to 0.05% and can be updated via Governance Vote. Use [FLASHLOAN\_PREMIUM\_TOTAL](/docs/developers/smart-contracts/pool#flashloan_premium_total) to get current value.

Flashloan fee can be shared by the LPs (liquidity providers) and the protocol treasury. The [FLASHLOAN\_PREMIUM\_TOTAL](/docs/developers/smart-contracts/pool#flashloan_premium_total) represents the total fee paid by the borrowers of which:

*   Fee to LP: [FLASHLOAN\_PREMIUM\_TOTAL](/docs/developers/smart-contracts/pool#flashloan_premium_total) - [FLASHLOAN\_PREMIUM\_TO\_PROTOCOL](/docs/developers/smart-contracts/pool#flashloan_premium_to_protocol)
    
*   Fee to Protocol: [FLASHLOAN\_PREMIUM\_TO\_PROTOCOL](/docs/developers/smart-contracts/pool#flashloan_premium_to_protocol)
    

At initialization, [FLASHLOAN\_PREMIUM\_TO\_PROTOCOL](/docs/developers/smart-contracts/pool#flashloan_premium_to_protocol) is set to 0.

### Step by step

[](#step-by-step)

#### 1\. Setting Up

[](#step-by-step-section-1-setting-up)

Your contract that receives the flash loaned amounts **must** conform to the [IFlashLoanSimpleReceiver](https://github.com/aave-dao/aave-v3-origin/blob/main/src/contracts/misc/flashloan/interfaces/IFlashLoanSimpleReceiver.sol) or [IFlashLoanReceiver](https://github.com/aave-dao/aave-v3-origin/blob/main/src/contracts/misc/flashloan/interfaces/IFlashLoanReceiver.sol) interface by implementing the relevant executeOperation() function.

Also note that since the owed amounts will be *pulled* from your contract, your contract must give allowance to the [Pool](/docs/developers/smart-contracts/pool) to pull those funds to pay back the flash loan amount + premiums.

#### 2\. Calling flashLoan() or flashLoanSimple()

[](#step-by-step-section-2-calling-flashloan-or-flashloansimple)

To call either of the two flash loan methods on the Pool, we need to pass in the relevant parameters. There are 3 ways you can do this.

1.  From an EOA ('normal' ethereum account)
    
    To use an EOA, send a transaction to the relevant [Pool](/docs/developers/smart-contracts/pool) calling the [flashLoan()](/docs/developers/smart-contracts/pool#flashloan) or [flashLoanSimple()](/docs/developers/smart-contracts/pool#flashloansimple) function. See the [Pool](/docs/developers/smart-contracts/pool) docs for parameter details, ensuring you use your contract address from [step 1](/docs/developers/flash-loans#1-setting-up) for the receiverAddress.
    
2.  From a different contract
    
    Similar to sending a transaction from an EOA as above, ensure the receiverAddress is your contract address from [step 1](/docs/developers/flash-loans#1-setting-up).
    
3.  From the *same* contract
    
    If you want to use the same contract as in step 1, use address(this) for the receiverAddress parameter in the flash loan method.
    

Never keep funds permanently on your [FlashLoanReceiverBase](https://github.com/aave-dao/aave-v3-origin/blob/main/src/contracts/flashloan/base/FlashLoanReceiverBase.sol) contract as they could be exposed to a ['griefing' attack](https://ethereum.stackexchange.com/a/92457/19365), where the stored funds are used by an attacker.

#### Completing the flash loan

[](#step-by-step-completing-the-flash-loan)

Once you have performed your logic with the flash loaned assets (in your executeOperation() function), you will need to pay back the flash loaned amounts if you used [flashLoanSimple()](/docs/developers/smart-contracts/pool#flashloansimple) or interestRateModes = 0 in [flashLoan()](/docs/developers/smart-contracts/pool#flashloan) for any of the assets in modes parameter.

*   #### Paying back a flash loaned asset
    
    [](#step-by-step-completing-the-flash-loan-paying-back-a-flash-loaned-asset)
    
    Ensure your contract has the relevant amount + premium to payback the borrowed asset. You can calculate this by taking the sum of the relevant entry in the amounts and premiums array passed into the executeOperation() function.
    
    You **do not** need to transfer the owed amount back to the [Pool](/docs/developers/smart-contracts/pool). The funds will be automatically *pulled* at the conclusion of your operation.
    
*   #### Incurring a debt (i.e. not immediately paying back)
    
    [](#step-by-step-completing-the-flash-loan-incurring-a-debt-ie-not-immediately-paying-back)
    
    If you initially used a mode=1 or mode=2 for any of the assets in the modes parameter, then the address passed in for onBehalfOf will incur the debt **if** the onBehalfOf address has previously approved the msg.sender to incur debts on their behalf.
    
    This means that you can have some assets that are paid back immediately, while other assets incur a debt.

### GHO Token

[](#gho-token)

#### transfer

[](#gho-token-transfer)

The simplest method for transferring ERC-20 tokens is transfer which can be used to send tokens to any address without a prior token approval. The limitation of transfer is that it must be executed directly by the token holder, so it cannot be used within a smart contract function call to retrieve funds from a user (EOA).

#### transferFrom

[](#gho-token-transferfrom)

To transfer tokens within a smart contract function, transferFrom is the method that is used. The transferFrom function requires the sender to have approved the spender address for at least the transfer amount. There are two methods which can be used to perform the approval:

#### approve

[](#gho-token-approve)

The standard ERC-20 approve requires an on-chain transaction from the token holder to a approve a specified spender and amount.

#### permit

[](#gho-token-permit)

EIP-2612 permit is a type of token approval which requires two components:

*   A signed approval message from the token holder which encodes: owner, spender, amount, nonce, deadline, DOMAIN\_SEPARATOR
    
*   An on-chain permit transaction which can be executed from any address
    

The advantages to using permit in place of approve are that the gas cost of the transaction can be paid for by an address other than the token owner, and can reduce the number of transactions by batching the permit call with another action, an example of this is [supplyWithPermit](https://github.com/aave-dao/aave-v3-origin/blob/ec33f4fcc5546710c0faca5208af1775c761ac9c/src/contracts/protocol/pool/Pool.sol#L154) from Aave Protocol V3.

### Facilitators

[](#facilitators)

#### Aave V3 Ethereum Market

[](#facilitators-aave-v3-ethereum-market)

Interacting with GHO via the Aave Pool Facilitator is very similar to interacting with a typical Aave reserve asset with two key differences:

*   GHO is minted, not supplied, therefore interest rate and available liquidity calculations are based on custom interest rate strategy and facilitator caps respectively
    
*   GHO has a discounted borrow rate for stkAAVE holders
    

Below are the technical guides for all GHO actions along with their contract references.

##### Minting

[](#facilitators-aave-v3-ethereum-market-minting)

Minting occurs through the borrow function of the Aave V3 Ethereum market. To mint GHO, the process is nearly identical to borrowing any other reserve. To mint, an address must have sufficient collateral which is performed by approving and then calling supply on the Aave Pool with an eligible collateral asset. Once an address has sufficient collateral, it is able to borrow up to a maximum collateral factor determined by its collateral asset composition.

Since GHO is created and not borrowed from suppliers, GHO is not subject to restrictions on available liquidity, and instead, the Facilitator cap and collateralization requirements define the limits to which GHO can be minted as calculated below.

availableFacilitatorCap = ghoReserveData.aaveFacilitatorButcketMaxCapacity - ghoReserveData.aaveFacilitatorBucketLevel

See [core functions](/docs/developers/smart-contracts/pool) for more information on integrating Aave borrow functionality.

##### Repay

[](#facilitators-aave-v3-ethereum-market-repay)

GHO is repaid just like any other asset, by approving the Pool contract to spend GHO tokens (by approval transaction or signed permit and repayWithPermit).

What is different about GHO is the calculation of accrued interest. See the discount dynamics section for more info on how accrued interest affects balances for repayment.

See [core functions](/docs/developers/smart-contracts/pool) for more information on integrating Aave repay functionality.

#### Liquidation

[](#facilitators-liquidation)

When an address has a GHO borrow position, they are eligible to be liquidated under the same conditions as any other collateralized address. If the health factor of a GHO borrow falls below one, which occurs when the sum of borrow value exceeds the weighted average of liquidation thresholds of collateral assets, then any address is eligible to make a liquidationCall on the Pool contract.

The liquidationCall repays up to 100% of the GHO borrow position in exchange for an equivalent USD valuation of the collateral plus a liquidation bonus.

See the developers [liquidation guide](/docs/developers/liquidations) for more information.

#### Flash Mint

[](#facilitators-flash-mint)

Since GHO is not borrowed like a typical Aave reserve, a separate Facilitator is used in place to replicate the flashloan functionality of the Aave Pool.

The FlashMinter Facilitator has a separate minting cap from the Aave Pool. Since all FlashMint transactions are returned in a single transaction, no GHO is ever minted against this Facilitator and the cap is applied to each transaction.

FlashMint is useful for a variety of applications such as liquidations, debt switches, and peg arbitrage. The GhoFlashMinter smart contract implements the following functions:

```
function maxFlashLoan(address token) external view override returns (uint256)
```

```
function getFee() external view override returns (uint256)
```

```

#### Stability Module

[](#facilitators-stability-module)

A Peg Stability Module (PSM) is a contract that enables the conversion of two tokens at a predetermined ratio. The GHO Stability Module (GSM) leverages the benefits of existing PSM models while innovating upon them in several ways to help further maintain GHO‚Äôs peg. The GSM is designed to facilitate conversions between GHO and governance-approved tokens, underpinned by a suite of features designed for flexible operations and risk management.

##### GSMRegistry

[](#facilitators-stability-module-gsmregistry)

The GSMRegistry is a smart contract that stores a list of all GSM instances. This contract is owned by the Aave Governance Short Executor.

##### GSM

[](#facilitators-stability-module-gsm)

Each token pairing in the stability module has a GSM or GSM4626 contract instance that acts as the GHO facilitator and entry-point for buy and sell functionality.

The GSM4626 contract is a special instance of the GSM that supports ERC-4626 tokenized vault shares as the exogenous token.

The parameters and periphery contracts that dictate module operations are detailed below:

##### Price Strategy

[](#facilitators-stability-module-price-strategy)

The GSM introduces a flexible Price Strategy framework, enabling the module to adapt its pricing mechanism based on market conditions or strategic objectives. This system supports both fixed and dynamic pricing strategies, allowing for adjustments in response to real-time market data or predetermined conditions. The initial implementation focuses on a fixed 1:1 pricing strategy for simplicity and stability, with provisions for future adaptation to dynamic strategies as dictated by DAO governance.

##### Fee Strategy

[](#facilitators-stability-module-fee-strategy)

Each GSM instance has a FeeStrategy contract that determines a percentage fee for buy and sell conversions that is allocated to the Aave DAO treasury.

##### Exposure Cap

[](#facilitators-stability-module-exposure-cap)

The exposure cap is a parameter determined by Aave DAO Governance that sets the maximum amount of an exogenous token the stability module can hold.

##### Conversion Freezes and Oracle Price Bounds

[](#facilitators-stability-module-conversion-freezes-and-oracle-price-bounds)

In case the price of the exogenous token deviates from a determined ratio, the freeze role can be utilized by the Aave DAO or assigned to an entity (autonomous agents or contracts) to respond and halt conversions.

An implementation of the freeze role is the OracleSwapFreezer contract. This contract utilizes Chainlink oracles and price bounds determined by Aave Governence to freeze/unfreeze based on oracle conditions.

##### Last Resort Liquidations

[](#facilitators-stability-module-last-resort-liquidations)

In case of a rapid increase in risk in an exogenous token, the GSM features Last Resort Liquidations to liquidate the exogenous token. This contract role allows in the worst-case scenarios for the DAO to pause GSM functionality and liquidate the underlying balance of exogenous tokens.

#### Cross-Chain

[](#facilitators-cross-chain)

All GHO tokens are originated on Ethereum mainnet. GHO is made available to access on other networks using an infrastructure of cross-chain messaging.

The Chainlink CCIP protocol has been approved by Aave Governance as the messaging bridge to facilitate the transfer of GHO between networks.

GHO is transferred by between networks by initiating a lock (Ethereum mainnet) or burn (other networks) action on the source network, and a release (Ethereum mainnet) or mint (other networks) action occurs on the destination chain after the cross-chain message has been validated.

The GHOCCIPTokenPoolEthereum contract facilitates the locking and burning of GHO on Ethereum and other chains, enabling GHO's presence across multiple DeFi ecosystems.

## Governance

[](#governance)

The Aave Protocol is governed by the AAVE token holder community through procedures, voting, and smart contract execution, collectively known as **Aave Governance**.

All instances of the Aave Protocol are governed by the AAVE, stkAAVE, and aAAVE token holders on **Ethereum mainnet**. [Aave Governance V3](https://github.com/bgd-labs/aave-governance-v3), developed by [BGD Labs](https://bgdlabs.com/), introduces the ability to vote on lower transaction fee networks such as Polygon POS and Avalanche C-Chain while token balances remain on Ethereum mainnet.

### Architecture

[](#architecture)

Aave Governance V3 is designed with a modular architecture to meet the comprehensive needs of an on-chain DAO like Aave. The system is divided into three main components, each corresponding to different stages in the proposal lifecycle:

*   **Core Network**: Acts as the settlement and security layer where voting power resides. It handles high-level validations on proposals and manages governance token balances. Ethereum Mainnet serves as the Core Network.
    
*   **Voting Networks**: Environments where voting occurs based on storage proofs. These networks are typically lower-cost environments like Polygon POS and Avalanche C-Chain, enabling users to vote without migrating funds from the Core Network.
    
*   **Execution Networks**: Networks where proposal payloads are registered and executed. They handle the execution of approved proposals across various networks, including all Voting Networks and the Core Network.
    

Communication between these components is facilitated by the [Aave Delivery Infrastructure](https://governance.aave.com/t/bgd-a-di-aave-delivery-infrastructure/13951) (a.DI), providing secure and efficient cross-chain interactions. Additionally, the [Aave Robot](https://governance.aave.com/t/bgd-aave-robot-v1/13091) automates permissionless actions in Aave Governance such as queueing and executing proposals.

### Voting

[](#voting)

In Governance V3, each proposal specifies a voting network and all voting for the proposal occurs on this network. The Governance V3 activation enables Polygon POS, Avalanche C-Chain, and Ethereum Mainnet (backup) as initial voting networks.

Voters do not need to migrate funds to the voting network, all governance token balances and delegations are still stored on Ethereum mainnet, and are validated on the voting network using storage proofs.

Voting is performing by calling the submitVote() function on the VotingMachine of the corresponding proposal‚Äôs voting network.

An [aave-cli](https://github.com/bgd-labs/aave-cli/blob/main/README.md) has been developed to generate the necessary storage proof parameters, or voting can performed with the [GovernanceV3Helpers](https://github.com/bgd-labs/aave-helpers?tab=readme-ov-file#govv3helpers) Foundry script.

#### Voting Power

[](#voting-voting-power)

AAVE, stkAAVE (AAVE staked in protocol safety module), and aAAVE (aToken representing AAVE supplied to Ethereum V3 market) token holders receive governance powers proportional to the sum of their balances on Ethereum mainnet.

There are two powers associated with each governance token:

*   The **proposal power** that gives access to creating a proposal.
    
*   The **voting power** which is used to vote for or against active proposals.
    

Governance powers can be either jointly or separately delegated to any Ethereum address.

#### Voting Representatives

[](#voting-voting-representatives)

Smart contract wallets cannot sign messages for storage proof voting and may not exist on all networks, this creates a challenge to interact with the cross-chain voting contracts.

To accommodate cross-chain voting for smart contract wallets and allow greater flexibility for all governance participants, wallets have the ability to link a representative address on other chains.

To choose a representative, an address in Ethereum should call the updateRepresentativesPerChain() function on the GovernanceCore smart contract.

This representative address is able to vote on the specified network, using the delegators balances and received delegations on Ethereum Mainnet. An address can be the representative of multiple other addresses.

#### Storage Proofs

[](#voting-storage-proofs)

Aave Governance V3 uses block hashes on the Core network (Ethereum Mainnet) as the source of information for voting balances, and storage proofs as the core mechanism for validation.

For any proposal, the system takes a ‚Äúsnapshot‚Äù (block hash of the block before activateVote method gets called) of voting token balances/delegations on the Core network, forwards it to an Aave Voting Network and sets it as the main source of balances/delegation to validate against whenever an address submits a vote there.

Ethereum block hashes contain the state tree of the network, which in turn contains all the data of all the smart contracts at that exact block. Amongst those contracts: AAVE, stkAAVE, and other voting assets are present, and within them, the balances and delegations of all Ethereum addresses.

Storage proofs are a mechanism allowing to cryptographically prove that a piece of data is contained in a tree. In this case, they allow proving that a specific address has voting balance/delegation on the state tree of an Ethereum block.

What happens in practice when an address votes is that the voter inputs the balance of the voting assets they hold at the proposal's Ethereum block, together with a storage proof over the Ethereum block hash for that proposal. The Voting Network then cryptographically verifies the storage proof against the Ethereum block data, along with all additional validations (e.g., no double-voting), and stores the results accordingly.

### Proposal Lifecycle

[](#proposal-lifecycle)

1.  **Payload Registration**: Proposal payloads containing executable logic are deployed and registered on the PayloadsController of the target Execution Network. This process is permissionless.
    
2.  **Proposal Creation**: A proposer with sufficient proposal power creates the proposal on the Core Network (Ethereum Mainnet) by interacting with the Governance contract. The proposer specifies the payload IDs and target networks.
    
3.  **Proposal Activation**: After a cooldown period (coolDownBeforeVotingStart), the proposal is activated. This involves taking a snapshot of the Core Network's state and forwarding it to the specified Voting Network using a.DI.
    
4.  **Voting Setup**: On the Voting Network, the necessary data (Ethereum block hash, state tree, voting asset roots) is settled in the DataWarehouse contract. This step is permissionless and can be performed by any address.
    
5.  **Voting Period**: Voting occurs on the Voting Network. Voters submit their votes by calling submitVote() on the VotingMachine, providing their token balances at the snapshot block along with storage proofs.
    
6.  **Vote Closure**: After the voting duration (votingDuration) elapses, voting is closed. The VotingMachine contract sends the voting results (YES and NO counts) back to the Core Network via a.DI.
    
7.  **Result Validation**: The Governance contract on the Core Network validates the voting results against success metrics, such as minimum thresholds and vote differentials.
    
8.  **Proposal Queuing**: If the proposal meets the success criteria, it is forwarded to the PayloadsController on the Execution Network, where it is queued in a timelock mechanism.
    
9.  **Proposal Execution**: After the timelock expires, any address can execute the proposal by calling executePayload() on the PayloadsController, which forwards it to the appropriate Executor for execution.

## üìÅ developers / Safety Module | Aave Protocol Documentation

*ÌååÏùº Í≤ΩÎ°ú: developers/safety_module.md*

Source: https://aave.com/docs/developers/safety-module

## Safety Module

[](#safety-module)

The Aave Safety Module serves as a safeguard for the Aave Protocol against potential shortfall events. By staking AAVE, GHO, or AAVE / wstETH Balancer Pool tokens, participants contribute to the security of the protocol and earn incentives in return. The staked tokens may be slashed in the event of a shortfall to cover any protocol deficits.

The Safety Module operates by allowing users to stake their ERC-20 tokens into StakeToken contracts, which are also ERC-20 tokens. These StakeToken contracts handle the distribution of rewards and manage the slashing mechanism. The implementation details of the StakeToken contracts are available on [GitHub](https://github.com/bgd-labs/aave-stk-gov-v3).

The [Umbrella](https://governance.aave.com/t/bgd-aave-safety-module-umbrella/18366) governance proposal outlines potential changes to the Safety Module, including automated slashing, replacing stkAAVE and stkABPT with aToken staking, and new incentives design, subject to community approval.

### Staking

[](#staking)

Users stake tokens by calling the stake function on the StakeToken contract with the amount they wish to stake. In exchange, they receive staked tokens adjusted by the current exchange rate, representing their share in the Safety Module.

```
function stake(address to, uint256 amount) external;
```

### Unstaking

[](#unstaking)

Before withdrawing their staked tokens, users must initiate a cooldown period by invoking the cooldown() function. After the cooldown period, defined by \_cooldownSeconds, has elapsed, there is a limited window (UNSTAKE\_WINDOW) during which users can redeem their staked tokens by calling the redeem function. If this window is missed, the cooldown process must be restarted.

```
function cooldown() external;function redeem(address to, uint256 amount) external;
```

Actions involving staked tokens can affect the cooldown period:

*   **Staking More Tokens**: Adding more tokens to your stake during an active cooldown doesn't impact the existing cooldown. The new tokens will require a separate cooldown period before they can be unstaked.
    
*   **Unstaking Tokens**: Once the cooldown period has passed, only the tokens that were in cooldown can be unstaked. Unstaking resets the cooldown for the withdrawn amount, and any remaining staked tokens will need a new cooldown period for future withdrawals.
    
*   **Claiming Rewards**: Collecting earned incentives doesn't affect the cooldown period. Users can claim rewards at any time without influencing their cooldown status.
    
*   **Transferring Staked Tokens**: Sending staked tokens to another address doesn't alter the sender's cooldown. The recipient must initiate their own cooldown period to unstake those tokens, as the cooldown is not transferred along with the tokens.
    

After the cooldown period concludes, users have a two-day window to unstake their tokens. Failing to do so within this timeframe means they must initiate the cooldown process again, waiting the full duration before being able to unstake.

### Exchange Rate Mechanism

[](#exchange-rate-mechanism)

The exchange rate determines how staked tokens convert back to the underlying assets. Initially set to a 1:1 ratio (1e18), the exchange rate adjusts in response to slashing events or when additional funds are added to the module. This mechanism determines the value of staked tokens to reflect the total assets within the Safety Module after such events. The exchange rate is calculated using the formula:

```
exchangeRate = (totalAssets * EXCHANGE_RATE_UNIT) / totalShares;
```

### Rewards

[](#rewards)

Participants earn rewards over time based on emission rates set by Aave Governance. The AaveDistributionManager contract manages the calculation and distribution of these incentives. Rewards are proportional to the amount staked and the duration of staking.

The formula for calculating accrued rewards is:

```
Accrued Rewards = (User's Stake * (Asset Index - User Index))
```

*   **Asset Index**: A cumulative value representing the total rewards per unit staked, updated regularly based on the emission rate and total staked tokens.
    
*   **User Index**: The index value recorded during the user's last interaction with the staking contract.
    

### Claiming Rewards

[](#claiming-rewards)

Users can claim their accumulated rewards at any time by calling the claimRewards function:

```
function claimRewards(address to, uint256 amount) external;
```

Claimed rewards are transferred to the user's wallet. This action does not affect the staking status or the cooldown period. Users with the appropriate permissions can also claim rewards on behalf of others using claimRewardsOnBehalf. Additionally, there's an option to claim rewards and immediately restake them in one transaction using claimRewardsAndStake, allowing users to compound rewards.

### Slashing

[](#slashing)

Slashing is a mechanism designed to cover losses in the event of a protocol shortfall by utilizing a portion of the staked funds. Only addresses with the SLASH\_ADMIN\_ROLE (held by [Aave Governance](/docs/primitives/governance)) can initiate a slashing event by calling the slash function:

```
function slash(address destination, uint256 amount) external onlySlashingAdmin returns (uint256);
```

The maximum slashing amount is determined per-asset by \_maxSlashablePercentage, a predefined limit set by the SLASH\_ADMIN\_ROLE.

After a slashing event, the exchange rate is updated to reflect the reduced total assets, proportionally affecting all stakers. The module then enters a post-slashing period during which:

*   New staking is temporarily disabled to prevent dilution of existing stakers' shares.
    
*   Stakers can redeem their tokens without waiting for a cooldown period, allowing them to exit the module promptly.
    
*   No further slashing events can occur until the current one is settled.
    

To conclude the post-slashing period and resume normal operations, the SLASH\_ADMIN\_ROLE must call:

```
function settleSlashing() external onlySlashingAdmin;
```

*   Tokenization
    
*   Helpers
    
*   Misc
    

### Pool

[](#pool)

#### Pool

[](#pool-pool)

The [Pool](/docs/developers/smart-contracts/pool) is the main entry point into the Aave Protocol. Most user interactions with the Aave Protocol occur via the Pool contract. Pool is owned by the PoolAddressesProvider of the specific market. All admin functions are callable by the PoolConfigurator contract, which is defined in PoolAddressesProvider.

#### L2Pool

[](#pool-l2pool)

The [L2Pool](/docs/developers/smart-contracts/l2-pool) is a modification of the Pool contract for L2 rollups, with gas-optimized user methods that takes byte encoded input arguments. It is a calldata optimized extension of the Pool contract allowing users to pass compact calldata representations to reduce transaction costs on rollups.

#### PoolConfigurator

[](#pool-poolconfigurator)

The [PoolConfigurator](/docs/developers/smart-contracts/pool-configurator) provides configuration methods for the Pool contract. The write methods of this contract can only be called by addresses with corresponding permissioned system roles that are managed by ACLManager.

### Configuration

[](#configuration)

#### ACLManager

[](#configuration-aclmanager)

The [ACLManager](/docs/developers/smart-contracts/acl-manager) contract is the main registry of system roles and permissions.

#### PoolAddressesProvider

[](#configuration-pooladdressesprovider)

The [PoolAddressesProvider](/docs/developers/smart-contracts/pool-addresses-provider) is a registry of various components of the protocol, including the ACLManager and Pool contracts, and has the ability to update pointers or update the implementation of proxy contracts.

### Logic

[](#logic)

[Libraries](https://github.com/aave-dao/aave-v3-origin/blob/main/src/contracts/protocol/libraries/logic/) that implement the base logic for various actions and functions.

### Tokenization

[](#tokenization)

#### AToken

[](#tokenization-atoken)

[ATokens](/docs/developers/smart-contracts/tokenization) are yield-generating tokens that are minted and burnt upon supply and withdraw of assets to Aave Pool.

#### VariableDebtToken

[](#tokenization-variabledebttoken)

[VariableDebtTokens](/docs/developers/smart-contracts/tokenization) are non-transferable interest accruing tokens representing variable borrow rate positions.

### Helpers

[](#helpers)

#### L2Encoder

[](#helpers-l2encoder)

The [L2Encoder](https://github.com/aave-dao/aave-v3-origin/blob/main/src/contracts/helpers/L2Encoder.sol) is a helper contract to encode calldata that is passed to the L2Pool. It is used to optimize calldata size in L2Pool for transaction cost reduction. It is only intended to help generate calldata for users/frontends.

#### AaveProtocolDataProvider

[](#helpers-aaveprotocoldataprovider)

The [AaveProtocolDataProvider](/docs/developers/smart-contracts/view-contracts) is a peripheral contract to collect and pre-process information from the Pool.

### Misc

[](#misc)

## Testing & Debugging

[](#testing-debugging)

This guide provides comprehensive instructions on how to test and debug Aave protocol integrations.

### Testing

[](#testing)

There are two primary methods for testing the Aave protocol: using a **testnet** or creating **fork networks**.

#### Testnet

[](#testing-testnet)

The Aave protocol is available for testing on the Sepolia testnet. You can access the Sepolia V3 testnet market by visiting [app.aave.com](https://app.aave.com) and enabling testnet mode in the top right corner.

To get started:

1.  Visit the test market on [app.aave.com](https://app.aave.com).
    
2.  Use the **Faucet** tab to acquire test tokens available in the market.
    
3.  Supply these tokens to the protocol.
    
4.  Perform operations such as borrowing, repaying, and withdrawing to test different functionalities.
    

#### Fork Networks

[](#testing-fork-networks)

A fork network replicates the state of a blockchain, allowing you to interact with it in a sandbox environment. This is especially useful for testing scenarios that depend on contracts and states existing on the mainnet.

##### Creating a Fork Network

[](#testing-fork-networks-creating-a-fork-network)

Several tools can help you create a fork network:

*   **[Tenderly](https://docs.tenderly.co/simulations-and-forks/forks)**: Debugging toolkit with fork networks, simulations, and online dashboard.
    
*   **[Foundry](https://book.getfoundry.sh/forge/fork-testing)**: Smart contract development framework.
    
*   **[Hardhat](https://hardhat.org/hardhat-network/docs/guides/forking-other-networks)**: Smart contract development framework.
    

To acquire tokens on a fork network, you can impersonate an address that holds the desired tokens (holders can be found using block explorers) and transfer them to your address.

##### Connecting the Fork Network to the UI

[](#testing-fork-networks-connecting-the-fork-network-to-the-ui)

The [app.aave.com](https://app.aave.com) interface can be configured to connect to a fork network. By setting specific variables via the browser console, you can enable this functionality. Refer to [this guide](https://github.com/aave/interface/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md#running-against-a-chain-fork) for detailed instructions.

### Debugging

[](#debugging)

When interacting with the Aave protocol, you may encounter smart contract errors. This section helps you understand how to interpret error codes, use debugging tools, and resolve common issues.

#### Error Codes

[](#debugging-error-codes)

The Aave protocol uses specific error codes to indicate why a transaction failed. Understanding these codes is essential for debugging. The error codes for each Aave protocol version are defined in their respective Errors.sol files:

*   **Aave V3 Error Codes**: [Errors.sol](https://github.com/aave-dao/aave-v3-origin/blob/main/src/contracts/protocol/libraries/helpers/Errors.sol)
    
*   **Aave V2 Error Codes**: [Errors.sol](https://github.com/aave/protocol-v2/blob/master/contracts/protocol/libraries/helpers/Errors.sol)
    

#### Debugging Tools

[](#debugging-debugging-tools)

To effectively debug transactions, you can use tools like **Tenderly**, **Hardhat**, and **Foundry**. These tools allow you to simulate transactions, inspect state changes, and step through execution to identify issues.

##### Tenderly

[](#debugging-debugging-tools-tenderly)

Tenderly allows you to simulate transactions and debug them step-by-step. By inputting the transaction details (to, from, data, and value), you can simulate the call and identify the cause of any revert, including error codes and stack traces.

##### Hardhat

[](#debugging-debugging-tools-hardhat)

Hardhat provides a local Ethereum environment for testing and debugging. It offers features like console logs in Solidity, detailed stack traces, and the ability to fork mainnet state for testing.

##### Foundry

[](#debugging-debugging-tools-foundry)

Foundry is a fast, portable, and modular toolkit for Ethereum application development. It includes tools like Forge for testing and debugging smart contracts, allowing you to simulate and debug transactions effectively.

##### Understanding "Gas Estimation Failed"

[](#debugging-debugging-tools-understanding-gas-estimation-failed)

The "Gas estimation failed" error is a generic message indicating that the transaction would fail if executed. To diagnose this issue:

1.  Use the transaction's to, from, data, and value fields.
    
2.  Simulate the transaction using one of the debugging tools mentioned above.
    
3.  Identify the specific error code or exception causing the failure.
    
4.  Examine the stack trace to pinpoint the issue.
    

#### Common Errors

[](#debugging-common-errors)

##### Aave V3 Pool

[](#debugging-common-errors-aave-v3-pool)

When interacting with the Aave V3 Pool, you may encounter issues related to token approvals, insufficient collateral, or reaching protocol limits.

###### ERC-20 Token Approval for Supply and Repay

Before supplying or repaying tokens, ensure that you have granted the Aave Pool contract an allowance to transfer tokens. This is performed by calling the approve function on the ERC-20 token contract to authorize the Pool as the spender.

###### Insufficient Collateral

If you're unable to borrow assets, it may be due to insufficient collateral or not meeting the required Loan-to-Value (LTV) ratios. Ensure that you have supplied enough collateral and that it satisfies the protocol's requirements.

###### Borrow Cap Reached

Sometimes, you may not be able to borrow a specific asset because the borrow cap has been reached. In this case, you may need to wait for borrowers to repay or supply more liquidity to the pool.

For more detailed explanations of potential revert cases, refer to this [DeFi Integration Guide](https://github.com/Walodja1987/DeFi-Integration-Guide/blob/main/AaveV3.1.md).

###### Loan To Value = 0%

When an Aave [reserve](/docs/primitives/reserve) has a Loan To Value (LTV) parameter configured to 0%, commonly referred to as **LTV0**, it impacts reserve interactions in several ways:

*   **Borrowing power**: Any existing collateral of this asset will no longer contribute to borrowing power.
    
*   **Collateral status**: The asset can no longer be enabled as collateral.
    
*   **Transfers**: If received via transfer, the asset will not be automatically enabled as collateral.
    
*   **Withdrawals**: Assets with LTV0 must be disabled as collateral (using Pool.setUserUseReserveAsCollateral or by fully withdrawing the supplied balance) before other assets can be withdrawn.
    

##### WrappedTokenGateway

[](#debugging-common-errors-wrappedtokengateway)

When interacting with Ether (ETH) in the Aave protocol, the WrappedTokenGateway is used to wrap ETH into WETH and vice versa. Common issues may include not sending ETH with the transaction when required or using incorrect functions for depositing or withdrawing ETH.

For detailed usage and potential revert causes, refer to the [WrappedTokenGateway documentation](/docs/developers/smart-contracts/wrapped-token-gateway).

## üìÅ developers/legacy_versions / Aave V1 | Aave Protocol Documentation

*ÌååÏùº Í≤ΩÎ°ú: developers/legacy_versions/v1.md*

Source: https://aave.com/docs/developers/legacy-versions/v1

## Aave v1

[](#aave-v1)

### Resources

[](#resources)

*   [Whitepaper](https://github.com/aave/aave-protocol/blob/master/docs/Aave_Protocol_Whitepaper_v1_0.pdf)
    
*   [Source Code](https://github.com/aave/aave-protocol)
    
*   [Contract Addresses](https://github.com/bgd-labs/aave-address-book/blob/main/src/AaveV1.sol)
    
*   [Interface](https://github.com/aave/aave-protocol)
    

### Key differences

[](#key-differences)

The following are key architectural differences between Aave v1 and subsequent protocol versions:

*   **Tokenization**: In V1, positions were not tokenized, meaning users had to manually calculate their supply & borrow balances by querying individual contracts.
    
*   **PoolCore**: V1 used a separate contract, PoolCore, to hold protocol assets, which added complexity for users and developers. In V2, this was replaced, and assets are held directly by aTokens.
    
*   **ETH -> WETH**: In V1, the protocol used ETH directly, but Aave V2 switched to WETH for consistency.
    
*   **Interest Redirection**: V1 allowed users to redirect earned interest to another address, a feature removed in V2.
    
*   **Batch Flash Loans**: V1 introduced flash loans, but they were limited to single transactions. V2 expanded this to batch flash loans and added new modes for flash loans with deferred repayment.
    
*   **Withdraw aTokens**: In V1, users had to redeem or withdraw their aTokens through the aToken contract. V2 migrated this action to the Pool contract.
    

### Architecture

[](#architecture)

#### Pool Core

[](#architecture-pool-core)

The PoolCore contract holds the state of every reserve and all assets supplied, as well as the basic logic (e.g. calculations using the stored data).

#### PoolAddressesProvider

[](#architecture-pooladdressesprovider)

The PoolAddressesProvider is a global addresses register of the protocol. This contract is immutable and the address will never change.

#### Pool Data Provider

[](#architecture-pool-data-provider)

The PoolDataProvider contract performs calculations and provides data for the Pool contract, specifically:

*   Calculates the ETH equivalent of a user's balance to assess the borrow limit of a user and the health factor of their positions.
    
*   Aggregates data from PoolCore to provide high level information to the Pool.
    
*   Calculates the Average Loan to Value and Average Liquidation Ratio.
    

#### Pool

[](#architecture-pool)

The Pool contract uses both the PoolCore and PoolDataProvider to interact with the reserves. This is the main contract developers should interface with. See the Pool section of the documentation.

The Pool also manages the tokenization of users' supply position via aTokens.

#### Pool Configurator

[](#architecture-pool-configurator)

The PoolConfigurator contract provides configuration functions for the Pool and PoolCore contracts. It also has a number of important functions:

*   Activates / Deactivates reserves,
    
*   Enables / Disables borrowing for a reserve,
    
*   Enables / Disables using a reserve as collateral,
    
*   Enables / Disables stable rate borrowing for a reserve,
    
*   Freezes / Unfreezes reserves,
    
*   Updates a reserve's Loan to Value,
    
*   Updates a reserve's liquidation threshold,
    
*   Updates a reserve's liquidation bonus,
    
*   Updates a reserve's decimals,
    
*   Updates a reserve's interest rate strategy address.
    

For all of the above functions, relevant events are emitted to the blockchain. Anyone can monitor these changes to know when values have been modified or added/removed.

The contract is owned by the PoolManager, as defined in the PoolAddressProvider.

#### Interest Rate Strategy

[](#architecture-interest-rate-strategy)

The InterestRateStrategy contract holds the information needed to calculate and update the interest rates of specific reserves.

Each contract stores the optimised base curves using the corresponding parameters of each currency. This means that there is a mathematical function which determines the interest rate of each asset pool, with the interest rate changing based on the amount of borrowed funds and the total liquidity (i.e. utilisation) of the asset pool.

The parameters for the optimised base curves are:

*   baseVariableBorrowRate
    
*   variableRateSlope1
    
*   variableRateSlope2
    
*   stableRateSlope1
    
*   stableRateSlope2
    

The interest rates are calculated depending on the available liquidity and the total borrowed amount.

Every reserve has a corresponding InterestRateStrategy contract.

### Architecture

[](#architecture)

#### Pool

[](#architecture-pool)

The main entry point into the Aave Protocol. Most interactions with Aave will happen via the Pool, including:

*   deposit()
    
*   borrow()
    
*   repay()
    
*   setUserUseReserveAsCollateral()
    
*   withdraw()
    
*   flashloan()
    
*   liquidationCall()
    

#### PoolAddressesProvider

[](#architecture-pooladdressesprovider)

The main addresses register of the protocol, for particular markets. The latest contract addresses should be retrieved from this contract by making the appropriate calls.

#### PoolAddressesProviderRegistry

[](#architecture-pooladdressesproviderregistry)

Contains a list of active PoolAddressesProvider addresses, for different markets.

#### aTokens

[](#architecture-atokens)

The yield-generating, tokenized representation of supplies used throughout the Aave protocol. They implement most of the standard EIP-20/ERC20 token methods with slight modifications, as well as Aave-specific methods including:

*   scaledBalanceOf()
    
*   getScaledUserBalanceAndSupply()
    
*   scaledTotalSupply()
    

All aTokens also implement EIP-2612, which via the permit() function enables single transaction approve + actions.

#### Variable Debt Tokens

[](#architecture-variable-debt-tokens)

The tokenized borrow positions used throughout the Aave protocol. Most of the standard EIP-20/ERC20 methods are disabled since debt tokens are non-transferrable.

#### Supporting Contracts

[](#architecture-supporting-contracts)

The following contracts should generally not be interacted with directly, but are used throughout the Aave Protocol via contract calls.

##### PoolCollateralManager

[](#architecture-supporting-contracts-poolcollateralmanager)

Using delegatecall via the Pool contract, the PoolCollateralManager implements actions involving the management of collateral in the protocol, including:

*   liquidationCall()
    

This function should only be called via the main Pool contract.

##### Pool Configurator

[](#architecture-supporting-contracts-pool-configurator)

Provides configuration functions for the Pool contracts. It has a number of important functions, such as:

*   Activates / Deactivates reserves
    
*   Enables / Disables borrowing for a reserve
    
*   Enables / Disables using a reserve as collateral
    
*   Enables / Disables stable rate borrowing for a reserve
    
*   Freezes / Unfreezes reserves
    
*   Updates a reserve's Loan to Value
    
*   Updates a reserve's liquidation threshold
    
*   Updates a reserve's liquidation bonus
    
*   Updates a reserve's decimals
    
*   Updates a reserve's interest rate strategy address
    
*   Activates / Deactivates all functions of a Pool in emergencies
    

For all of the above functions, relevant events are emitted to the blockchain. Anyone can monitor these changes to know when values have been modified or added/removed.

##### Interest Rate Strategy

[](#architecture-supporting-contracts-interest-rate-strategy)

Holds the information needed to calculate and update the interest rates of specific reserves. Each contract stores the optimized base curves using the corresponding parameters of each currency. The parameters for the optimized base curves are:

*   baseVariableBorrowRate
    
*   variableRateSlope1
    
*   variableRateSlope2
    
*   stableRateSlope1
    
*   stableRateSlope2
    

The interest rates are calculated depending on the available liquidity and the total borrowed amount.

## üìÅ developers/smart_contracts / ACL Manager | Aave Protocol Documentation

*ÌååÏùº Í≤ΩÎ°ú: developers/smart_contracts/acl_manager.md*

Source: https://aave.com/docs/developers/smart-contracts/acl-manager

## ACLManager

[](#aclmanager)

The Access Control List Manager (ACLManager) is the main registry of system roles and permissions.

The Aave Protocol implements an access control list to segregate powers and/or benefits that can be allocated to different entities on the protocol. The ACL\_MANAGER contract is managed by the [PoolAddressesProvider](/docs/developers/smart-contracts/pool-addresses-provider) contract.

ACLManager keeps track of the individual roles and its holders, and allows a *Role Admin* to manage roles. *Role Admin* is itself a role that is managed by the DEFAULT\_ADMIN\_ROLE.

The DEFAULT\_ADMIN\_ROLE is held by the [ACL\_ADMIN](/docs/developers/smart-contracts/acl-manager#acl_admin), and should be initialized in the [PoolAddressesProvider](/docs/developers/smart-contracts/poola-ddresses-provider) beforehand.

The source code is available on [GitHub](https://github.com/aave-dao/aave-v3-origin/blob/main/src/contracts/protocol/configuration/ACLManager.sol).

## üìÅ developers/smart_contracts / Incentives | Aave Protocol Documentation

*ÌååÏùº Í≤ΩÎ°ú: developers/smart_contracts/incentives.md*

Source: https://aave.com/docs/developers/smart-contracts/incentives

## Incentives

[](#incentives)

The [UiIncentiveDataProvider](/docs/developers/smart-contracts/view-contracts) provides methods to query all active incentive emissions, and claimable user incentives for a particular Aave market.

## RewardsController

[](#rewardscontroller)

RewardsController is the main rewards contract where the user interacts to claim the rewards of their positions. It is an abstract contract template to build Distributors contracts for ERC20 rewards to protocol participants. RewardsController inherits from [RewardsDistributor](https://github.com/aave-dao/aave-v3-origin/blob/main/src/contracts/rewards/RewardsDistributor.sol) to handle the distribution of rewards. The users of the incentivized ERC20 assets will accrue value if they hold their tokens in possession without the need for staking or blocking the assets inside a contract.

The users can claim all the rewards or an individual reward per transaction, with a variety of functions that allow more granularity at claim.

At every transfer, the asset must call the handleAction method to account for the user's rewards.

The source code is available on [GitHub](https://github.com/aave-dao/aave-v3-origin/blob/main/src/contracts/rewards/RewardsController.sol).

## Interest Rate Strategy

[](#interest-rate-strategy)

Borrow / WithdrawSupply / RepayBorrow rateSupply rate

Implements the calculation of the interest rates depending on the reserve state. The model of interest rate is based on two slopes, one before the OPTIMAL\_USAGE\_RATIO point of usage and another from that point to 100%.

An instance of this same contract can't be used across different Aave markets due to the caching of the [PoolAddressesProvider](/docs/developers/smart-contracts/pool-addresses-provider).

## üìÅ developers/smart_contracts / L2 Pool | Aave Protocol Documentation

*ÌååÏùº Í≤ΩÎ°ú: developers/smart_contracts/l2_pool.md*

Source: https://aave.com/docs/developers/smart-contracts/l2-pool

## L2Pool

[](#l2pool)

The main transaction cost on L2 comes from calldata. To minimize this cost, Aave V3 uses a different contract on L2 networks that allows calldata of Pool methods to be compressed.

L2Pool is the contract for the L2 optimized user facing methods of the protocol that takes byte encoded input arguments. It exposes the liquidity management methods that can be invoked using either Solidity or Web3 libraries. The L2Pool contract is a calldata optimized extension of the Pool contract allowing users to pass compact calldata representation to reduce transaction costs on L2 rollups.

Pool methods not exposed in L2Pool.sol (such as flashLoan, setUserEMode etc.) are the same on L2 as on other versions of protocol. Refer to [Pool](/docs/developers/smart-contracts/pool) docs for the rest of the methods.

Since there are a limited set of supported assets that are already given an individual id, we use the 16 bit asset id in the encoded arguments instead of 160 bit asset address.

The source code is available on [GitHub](https://github.com/aave-dao/aave-v3-origin/blob/main/src/contracts/protocol/pool/L2Pool.sol).

Threre is an additional [L2Encoder](https://github.com/aave-dao/aave-v3-origin/blob/main/src/contracts/helpers/L2Encoder.sol) helper contract with view methods to encode transaction params for compressed methods.

### Methods

[](#methods)

#### supply

[](#methods-supply)

```
function supply(bytes32 args) external override
```

Calldata efficient wrapper of the supply function on behalf of the caller. Supplies asset into the protocol, minting the same amount of corresponding aTokens, and transferring them to msg.sender.

## üìÅ developers/smart_contracts / Pool Addresses Provider | Aave Protocol Documentation

*ÌååÏùº Í≤ΩÎ°ú: developers/smart_contracts/pool_addresses_provider.md*

Source: https://aave.com/docs/developers/smart-contracts/pool-addresses-provider

## PoolAddressesProvider

[](#pooladdressesprovider)

The PoolAddressesProvider contract is the main registry of addresses that are part of, or connected to the Protocol, including permissioned roles. It acts as a factory of proxies and is the admin of those, and therefore has the right to change its implementations.

The addresses provider manages various protocol modules and has the ability to update pointers (e.g. update the [ACLManager](/docs/developers/smart-contracts/acl-manager) contract) or update the implementation of proxy contracts (e.g. update the [Pool](/docs/developers/smart-contracts/pool) implementation).

It specifies the initial holder of the [DEFAULT\_ADMIN\_ROLE](/docs/developers/smart-contracts/acl-manager), it is immutable, and the address will never change.

Whenever the [Pool](/docs/developers/smart-contracts/pool) contract is needed, we recommended you fetch the correct address from this PoolAddressesProvider smart contract.

The source code is available on [GitHub](https://github.com/aave-dao/aave-v3-origin/blob/main/src/contracts/protocol/configuration/PoolAddressesProvider.sol).

This contract is owned by the [Aave Governance](https://governance.aave.com/).

## üìÅ developers/smart_contracts / Pool | Aave Protocol Documentation

*ÌååÏùº Í≤ΩÎ°ú: developers/smart_contracts/pool.md*

Source: https://aave.com/docs/developers/smart-contracts/pool

## Pool

[](#pool)

This contract is the main user-facing contract. Most user interactions with the Aave Protocol occur via the Pool contract. It exposes the liquidity management methods that can be invoked using either ***Solidity*** or ***Web3*** libraries.

Pool.sol allows users to:

*   Supply
    
*   Withdraw
    
*   Borrow
    
*   Repay
    
*   Enable/disable supplied assets as collateral
    
*   Liquidate positions
    
*   Execute Flash Loans
    

Pool is covered by a proxy contract and is owned by the [PoolAddressesProvider](/docs/developers/smart-contracts/pool-addresses-provider) of the specific market. All admin functions are callable by the [PoolConfigurator](/docs/developers/smart-contracts/pool-configurator) contract defined in the [PoolAddressesProvider](/docs/developers/smart-contracts/pool-addresses-provider).

The source code is available on [GitHub](https://github.com/aave-dao/aave-v3-origin/blob/main/src/contracts/protocol/pool/Pool.sol).

### Write Methods

[](#write-methods)

#### initialize

[](#write-methods-initialize)

```
function initialize(IPoolAddressesProvider provider) external virtual
```

Initializes the Pool.

Function is invoked by the proxy contract when the Pool contract is added to the [PoolAddressesProvider](/docs/developers/smart-contracts/pool-addresses-provider) of the market.

Caches the address of the [PoolAddressesProvider](/docs/developers/smart-contracts/pool-addresses-provider) in order to reduce gas consumption on subsequent operations.

##### Input Parameters:

[](#write-methods-initialize-input-parameters)

Name

Type

Description

provider

address

The address of the PoolAddressesProvider

#### supply

[](#write-methods-supply)

```
function supply(    address asset,    uint256 amount,    address onBehalfOf,    uint16 referralCode) public virtual override
```

Supplies a certain amount of an asset into the protocol, minting the same amount of corresponding aTokens and transferring them to the onBehalfOf address. For example, if a user supplies 100 USDC and onBehalfOf address is the same as msg.sender, they will get 100 aUSDC in return.

The referralCode is emitted in Supply event and can be for third-party referral integrations. To activate the referral feature and obtain a unique referral code, integrators need to submit a proposal to Aave Governance.

When supplying, the Pool contract must have allowance() to spend funds on behalf of msg.sender for at least the amount for the asset being supplied. This can be done via the standard ERC20 approve() method on the underlying token contract.

Referral supply is currently inactive, you can pass 0 as referralCode. This program may be activated in the future through an Aave governance proposal.

##### Input Parameters:

[](#write-methods-supply-input-parameters)

Name

Type

Description

asset

address

The address of the underlying asset being supplied to the pool

amount

uint256

The amount of asset to be supplied

onBehalfOf

address

The address that will receive the corresponding aTokens. This is the only address that will be able to withdraw the asset from the pool. This will be the same as msg.sender if the user wants to receive aTokens into their own wallet, or use a different address if the beneficiary of aTokens is a different wallet

referralCode

uint16

Referral supply is currently inactive, you can pass 0. This code is used to register the integrator originating the operation, for potential rewards. 0 if the action is executed directly by the user, without any middle-men

#### supplyWithPermit

[](#write-methods-supplywithpermit)

```
function supplyWithPermit(    address asset,    uint256 amount,    address onBehalfOf,    uint16 referralCode,    uint256 deadline,    uint8 permitV,    bytes32 permitR,    bytes32 permitS) public virtual override
```

Supply with transfer approval of the asset to be supplied via permit function. This method removes the need for separate approval tx before supplying asset to the pool. See: [https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-2612](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-2612).

Permit signature must be signed by msg.sender with spender as Pool address.

Referral program is currently inactive, you can pass 0 as referralCode. This program may be activated in the future through an Aave governance proposal.

[](#write-methods-withdraw)

```
function withdraw(address asset, uint256 amount, address to) public virtual override returns (uint256)
```

Withdraws an amount of underlying asset from the reserve, burning the equivalent aTokens owned. For example, if a user has 100 aUSDC and calls withdraw(), they will receive 100 USDC, burning the 100 aUSDC.

If user has any existing debt backed by the underlying token, then the maximum amount available to withdraw is the amount that will not leave user's health factor < 1 after withdrawal.

When withdrawing to another address, msg.sender should have aToken that will be burned by Pool.

Reserves with a Loan To Value parameter of 0% must be disabled as collateral (using Pool.setUserUseReserveAsCollateral or by fully withdrawing the supplied balance) before other assets can be withdrawn.

##### Input Parameters:

Name

Type

Description

asset

address

The address of the underlying asset to withdraw, not the aToken

amount

uint256

The underlying amount to be withdrawn (the amount supplied), expressed in wei units. Use type(uint).max to withdraw the entire aToken balance

to

address

The address that will receive the underlying asset. This will be the same as msg.sender if the user wants to receive the tokens into their own wallet, or use a different address if the beneficiary is a different wallet

##### Return Values:

[](#write-methods-withdraw-return-values)

#### borrow

[](#write-methods-borrow)

```
function borrow(    address asset,    uint256 amount,    uint256 interestRateMode,    uint16 referralCode,    address onBehalfOf) public virtual override
```

Allows users to borrow a specific amount of the reserve underlying asset, provided the borrower has already supplied enough collateral, or they were given enough allowance by a credit delegator on the corresponding debt token (VariableDebtToken). For example, if a user borrows 100 USDC passing their own address as onBehalfOf, they will receive 100 USDC into their wallet and 100 variable debt tokens.

NOTE: If onBehalfOf is not the same as msg.sender, then onBehalfOf must have supplied enough collateral via supply() and have delegated credit to msg.sender via approveDelegation().

```

Repays a borrowed amount on a specific reserve, burning the equivalent debt tokens owned. For example, if a user repays 100 USDC, the 100 variable debt tokens owned by the onBehalfOf address will be burned.

When repaying, the Pool contract must have allowance to spend funds on behalf of msg.sender for at least the amount for the asset you are repaying with. This can be done via the standard ERC20 approve() method on the underlying token contract.

#### setUserUseReserveAsCollateral

[](#write-methods-setuserusereserveascollateral)

```
function setUserUseReserveAsCollateral(address asset, bool useAsCollateral) public virtual override
```

Allows suppliers to enable/disable a specific supplied asset as collateral. Sets the asset of msg.sender to be used as collateral or not.

An asset in [Isolation Mode](/docs/developers/aave-v3) can be enabled to use as collateral only if no other asset is already enabled to use as collateral.

An asset with LTV parameter of 0% cannot be enabled as collateral.

The user won‚Äôt be able to disable an asset as collateral if they have an outstanding debt position which could be left with the Health Factor < HEALTH\_FACTOR\_LIQUIDATION\_THRESHOLD on disabling the given asset as collateral.

##### Input Parameters:

[](#write-methods-setuserusereserveascollateral-input-parameters)

Name

Type

Description

asset

address

The address of the underlying asset supplied

useAsCollateral

bool

true if the user wants to use the supply as collateral, false otherwise

#### liquidationCall

[](#write-methods-liquidationcall)

```
function liquidationCall(    address collateralAsset,    address debtAsset,    address user,    uint256 debtToCover,    bool receiveAToken) public virtual override
```

Function to liquidate a non-healthy position collateral-wise, with Health Factor below 1.

When the health factor of a position is below 1, the caller (liquidator) repays the debtToCover amount of debt of the user getting liquidated. This is part or all of the outstanding borrowed amount on behalf of the borrower. The caller then receives a proportional amount of the collateralAsset (discounted amount of collateral) plus a liquidation bonus to cover market risk.

Liquidators can decide if they want to receive an equivalent amount of collateral aTokens instead of the underlying asset. When the liquidation is completed successfully, the health factor of the position is increased, bringing the health factor above 1.

Liquidators can only close a certain amount of collateral defined by a close factor. Currently the **close factor is 0.5**. In other words, liquidators can only liquidate a maximum of 50% of the amount pending to be repaid in a position. The liquidation discount applies to this amount.

*   *In most scenarios*, profitable liquidators will choose to liquidate as much as they can (50% of the user position).
    
*   debtToCover parameter can be set to uint(-1) and the protocol will proceed with the highest possible liquidation allowed by the close factor.
    
*   To check a user's health factor, use \[getUserAccountData()\].
    

Liquidators must approve() the Pool contract to use debtToCover of the underlying ERC20 of the asset used for the liquidation.

##### Input Parameters:

data

uint256

Bitmap of the users collaterals and borrows. It is divided into pairs of bits, one pair per asset. The first bit indicates if an asset is used as collateral by the user, the second whether an asset is borrowed by the user. The corresponding assets are in the same position as getReservesList(). For example, if the hex value returned is 0x40020, which represents a decimal value of 262176, then in binary it is 1000000000000100000. If we format the binary value into pairs, starting from the right, we get 1 00 00 00 00 00 00 10 00 00. If we start from the right and move left in the above binary pairs, the third pair is 10. Therefore the 1 indicates that third asset from the reserveList is used as collateral, and 0 indicates it has not been borrowed by this user

## Switch Adapters

[](#switch-adapters)

These switch adapters integrate Aave's Flash Loans and the ParaSwap DEX aggregator smart contracts to facilitate advanced actions such as repaying borrow positions using collateral, switching collateral assets, switching borrow positions, and withdrawing and switching assets. They allow users to perform complex operations in a single transaction, leveraging the liquidity of the Aave protocol and the atomic switching capabilities of decentralized exchanges.

The table below outlines switch feature availability across V3 markets on the [Aave Labs interface](https://app.aave.com):

### Repay With Collateral

[](#repay-with-collateral)

The ParaSwapRepayAdapter contract enables users to repay their borrow positions on Aave using their supplied collateral directly, without the need to unwind their positions or provide additional liquidity. It leverages Aave's Flash Loans and the ParaSwap DEX aggregator to switch the user's collateral for the borrowed asset and repay the borrow position in a single atomic transaction.

By using this adapter, users can efficiently manage their positions and reduce their borrow positions using their existing collateral, saving on transaction costs and avoiding manual steps.

The source code is available on [GitHub](https://github.com/aave-dao/aave-v3-origin/blob/main/src/contracts/extensions/paraswap-adapters/ParaSwapRepayAdapter.sol).

Reference Integration: [useCollateralRepaySwap.tsx](https://github.com/aave/interface/blob/main/src/hooks/paraswap/useCollateralRepaySwap.tsx)

```
function executeOperation(    address asset,    uint256 amount,    uint256 premium,    address initiator,    bytes calldata params) external override nonReentrant returns (bool)
```

Uses the received funds from the flash loan to repay a borrow position on the protocol on behalf of the user. Then, pulls the collateral from the user and switches it to the debt asset to repay the flash loan.

The user should give this contract allowance to pull the aTokens in order to withdraw the underlying asset, switch it, and repay the flash loan.

Supports only one asset on the flash loan.

The params parameter should be the ABI-encoded values of the following:

## Tokenization

[](#tokenization)

## AToken

[](#atoken)

aTokens are tokens minted and burnt upon supply and withdraw of assets to an Aave market. aTokens denote the amount of crypto assets supplied to the protocol and the yield earned on those assets. The aTokens‚Äô value is pegged to the value of the corresponding supplied asset at a 1:1 ratio and can be safely stored, transferred or traded. All yield collected by the aTokens' reserves are distributed to aToken holders directly by continuously increasing their wallet balance.

This contract is the implementation of the interest bearing token for the Aave Protocol. It inherits the [ScaledBalanceTokenBase](https://github.com/aave-dao/aave-v3-origin/blob/main/src/contracts/protocol/tokenization/base/ScaledBalanceTokenBase.sol) and [EIP712Base](https://github.com/aave-dao/aave-v3-origin/blob/main/src/contracts/protocol/tokenization/base/EIP712Base.sol) token contracts.

All standard EIP20 methods are implemented for aTokens, such as balanceOf, transfer, transferFrom, approve, totalSupply etc.

balanceOf will always return the most up to date balance of the user, which includes their principal balance and the yield generated by the principal balance.

The source code is available on [GitHub](https://github.com/aave-dao/aave-v3-origin/blob/main/src/contracts/protocol/tokenization/AToken.sol).

[](#staticatokenfactory)

The StataTokenFactory is a factory and registry contract that manages all deployed StataToken instances for a specified Aave pool. It allows deploying new StataToken instances on demand and validates that there is only one StataToken instance per underlying asset. This contract maintains a mapping between underlying assets and their corresponding StataToken addresses.

StataTokens are ERC-4626 compliant tokens that wrap Aave's aTokens to provide a non-rebasing yield accrual mechanism.

The source code is available on [GitHub](https://github.com/aave-dao/aave-v3-origin/blob/main/src/contracts/protocol/tokenization/StataTokenFactory.sol).

## Wrapped Token Gateway

[](#wrapped-token-gateway)

The Aave Protocol operates exclusively with ERC-20 [reserve](/docs/primitives/reserve) tokens. To accommodate network gas tokens, the WrappedTokenGateway (previously called WETHGateway) is a helper contract that enables gas tokens (ETH, POL, etc.) to be wrapped or unwrapped to perform Aave Pool methods:

*   Supply
    
*   Borrow
    
*   Repay
    
*   Withdraw

## üìÅ primitives / AAVE Token | Aave Protocol Documentation

*ÌååÏùº Í≤ΩÎ°ú: primitives/aave.md*

Source: https://aave.com/docs/primitives/aave

## AAVE

[](#aave)

The AAVE token is the native governance token of the Aave Protocol. It empowers holders to participate in decision-making through protocol governance. AAVE is an ERC-20 token deployed on the Ethereum blockchain and is widely accessible across various centralised and decentralised exchanges.

### Governance

[](#governance)

AAVE token holders have the ability to influence the future of the Aave Protocol through governance. Both AAVE and safety module staked AAVE (stkAAVE) holders can vote on proposals or delegate their voting power to others. By participating in governance votes, holders contribute to decisions on protocol deployments, parameter adjustments, features, and more.

### Liquidity Pools

[](#liquidity-pools)

AAVE tokens can be supplied to liquidity pools within the Aave Protocol, or external pools such as decentralised exchanges, allowing users to earn yield.

Holders can stake their tokens in the Aave safety module, enhancing the system's security by providing a backstop in case of insolvency and earning rewards in return. Staking AAVE can also grant reduced GHO borrowing rates, adding further incentives for participation. Additionally, AAVE tokens can be supplied to the Aave markets as collateral, allowing users to borrow other assets and increase their capital efficiency.

### Cross-Chain

[](#cross-chain)

Furthermore, AAVE has cross-chain implementation on several networks using canonical network messaging bridges. This enables users to access AAVE across different blockchain networks, with the acknowledgment that the ability to bridge tokens to and from Ethereum depends on the availability of the network bridge.

Token Deployments:

*   [Ethereum Mainnet](https://etherscan.io/address/0x7Fc66500c84A76Ad7e9c93437bFc5Ac33E2DDaE9)

## üìÅ primitives / GHO Token | Aave Protocol Documentation

*ÌååÏùº Í≤ΩÎ°ú: primitives/gho.md*

Source: https://aave.com/docs/primitives/gho

## GHO

[](#gho)

GHO (pronounced "go") is a decentralised, over-collateralised stablecoin that is fully backed, transparent, and native to the Aave Protocol. Designed to maintain a value pegged to the U.S. dollar, GHO is minted by users on demand, subject to mint cap limitations set by Aave's governance. Its stability is maintained through market efficiencies and over-collateralisation mechanisms inherent in the Aave Protocol.

### Facilitators

[](#facilitators)

Facilitators are contract addresses approved by Aave Governance with the ability to mint and burn GHO tokens. Each facilitator operates under a specific bucket cap, controlling the maximum amount of GHO they can generate. Facilitators play a crucial role in maintaining GHO's stability and integrating it across various platforms and use cases.

#### Aave Ethereum V3 Market

[](#facilitators-aave-ethereum-v3-market)

The Aave V3 Ethereum Market serves as a primary facilitator for GHO. Users can mint GHO by supplying approved collateral assets into the Aave Protocol and borrowing GHO against them. This process follows standard over-collateralisation practices, ensuring the protocol's security and the stablecoin's reliability. GHO has a discount mechanism that enables holder of stkAAVE (see [safety module](/docs/primitives/safety-module)) to borrow GHO at a discounted rate from the Aave V3 Ethereum Market.

#### Flash Mint

[](#facilitators-flash-mint)

The FlashMinter facilitator allows users to access uncollateralised GHO through flash loans, provided the borrowed amount is returned within the same transaction. This feature enables arbitrage opportunities and enhances liquidity without permanently increasing the overall supply of GHO.

#### GHO Stability Module (GSM)

[](#facilitators-gho-stability-module-gsm)

The GHO Stability Module acts as a facilitator to help maintain GHO's peg to the U.S. dollar. It allows users to swap GHO for other stable assets, providing a mechanism to absorb market imbalances and keep GHO's price stable.

#### Cross-Chain

[](#facilitators-cross-chain)

Cross-chain liquidity pools enable GHO to be used across different blockchain networks. Utilising CCIP, GHO can be bridged to other chains, allowing users to access liquidity pools on platforms outside of Ethereum. This cross-chain functionality expands GHO's utility and integrates it with a broader range of DeFi applications.

*   [Base](https://basescan.org/address/0x6Bb7a212910682DCFdbd5BCBb3e28FB4E8da10Ee)
    

### GHO Liquidity Committee

[](#gho-liquidity-committee)

The GHO Liquidity Committee (GLC) was created in October 2023 to focus solely on the liquidity of the GHO stablecoin. The committee was formed through a [governance proposal](https://governance-v2.aave.com/governance/proposal/343/) and consisted of a small team. After a successful initial 3-month period, it was [integrated](https://governance-v2.aave.com/governance/proposal/407/) into the Aave Liquidity Committee (ALC).

The ALC's main responsibilities regarding GHO include:

*   Providing analytics and modelling of the liquidity strategy
    
*   Liaising with teams that support the protocols hosting GHO liquidity
    
*   Leading and coordinating the committee's weekly activities
    
*   Providing critical feedback and helping refine the strategy
    
*   Verifying and signing transactions
    

The ALC's performance measures and liquidity targets for GHO can be found on the [GHO Analytics platform](https://aave.tokenlogic.xyz/liquidity-committee) provided by TokenLogic.

More information regarding the role of the GHO Liquidity Committee can be found in [Aave's Governance forum](https://governance.aave.com/t/temp-check-treasury-management-create-and-fund-gho-liquidity-committee/14800).

### GHO Stewards

[](#gho-stewards)

GHO Stewards is an additional entity created in April 2024 to more flexibly manage GHO market parameters, enabling GHO to be scaled per prevailing market conditions. The source code for GHO Steward contracts can be found on [GitHub](https://github.com/aave/gho-core/tree/main/src/contracts/misc).

The GHO Stewards determine if and how much to adjust the following, subject to pre-defined and Governance accepted thresholds:

*   GHO Borrow Cap
    
*   GHO Borrow Rate
    
*   GSM Exposure Cap
    
*   GSM Bucket Capacity
    
*   GSM Price Strategy
    
*   GSM Fee Strategy
    
*   GSM Price Range (Freeze, Unfreeze)
    

With many liquidity pools being created and rewards distributed across them, it is important that the DAO can swiftly increase the GHO Borrow Cap to mitigate GHO trading above $1. The GHO Stewards can swiftly increase the GHO Borrow Cap to mitigate GHO trading above the peg. The GHO Stewards can increase the GHO Borrow Cap to a threshold of 50M units to a total borrow cap of 100M.

The Borrow Rate must be adjusted gradually to enable the ecosystem to expand safely. If the trailing 30-day average price of GHO stays outside a $0.995 - $1.005 price range, the GHO Stewards are able to adjust the Borrow Rate no more than 500bps per 2-day period, up to a maximum 25% APR.

GHO Stewards consist of members from Growth (ACI), Risk (ChaosLabs), and Finance (TokenLogic + karpatkey) Service Providers and utilise a 3 of 4 multi-sig.

### Liquidity Pools

[](#liquidity-pools)

Liquidity pools are vital for providing market liquidity for GHO, enabling users to trade, borrow, and supply GHO across various platforms.

The Aave community, through the Liquidity Committee, may offer incentives to liquidity providers who supply GHO to specific pools. These incentives can include reward tokens or reduced fees, encouraging users to add liquidity and improve market depth. Incentivized liquidity pools help keep GHO readily available and maintain its peg to the U.S. dollar.

## Governance

[](#governance)

The Aave DAO is a decentralised collective of AAVE token holders and contributors who work together to shape the future of the protocol through a structured governance process. This community-driven model enables participants to propose, discuss, and vote on critical changes, guiding the evolution of the protocol and aligning with the collective goals of its members.

### Processes

[](#processes)

Aave's governance process is structured so that the protocol remains decentralised, secure, and adaptable. The lifecycle of a proposal is carefully designed to allow community members to present ideas, vote on them, and execute approved changes through a transparent and structured process.

#### Proposal Lifecycle

[](#processes-proposal-lifecycle)

1.  **Governance Forum** The proposal process begins with an idea introduced to the [Aave Governance Forum](https://governance.aave.com). This is where initial discussions take place and feedback is gathered. The community helps refine the proposal before moving to the next stage.
    
2.  **Temp Check (Snapshot Voting)** After discussion, the proposal proceeds to a TEMP CHECK via the [Aave Snapshot Space](https://snapshot.org/#/aave.eth). This informal vote gauges community sentiment. TEMP CHECK votes are non-binding but help determine if there is sufficient interest in moving forward. Proposals in this stage do not require detailed technical specifics.
    
3.  **ARFC (Aave Request for Final Comments)** If the TEMP CHECK passes, the proposal moves to the ARFC stage, where it undergoes more formal scrutiny. Service providers and community members contribute detailed feedback on how the proposal would impact the protocol, preparing it for the AIP stage. ARFC voting also occurs on the [Aave Snapshot Space](https://snapshot.org/#/aave.eth).
    
4.  **AIP (Aave Improvement Proposal)** The AIP stage is where the proposal becomes a formal, onchain submission. It includes two parts: metadata (stored on IPFS) and the contract payload. These are submitted through Aave's governance contracts, primarily on the Ethereum Mainnet.
    
5.  **Voting** Once submitted, the AIP enters a PENDING status before becoming ACTIVE for voting. Voting is conducted onchain through Aave governance contracts. A proposal succeeds if it meets quorum and vote differential requirements. If these thresholds aren‚Äôt met, the proposal fails.
    
6.  **Execution** A successful proposal moves to the execution phase, where it is enacted via Aave's governance infrastructure. Depending on the type of proposal, a timelock delay (either one day or 7 days) is imposed before the changes are implemented. Cross-chain proposals are executed using Aave's Delivery Infrastructure (a.DI).
    

#### Voting Overview

[](#processes-voting-overview)

IntroductionTemp CheckAave Request for Final Comments (ARFC)Aave Improvement Proposal (AIP)VotingExecutionGovernance ForumSnapshotOnchain

##### Off-chain Voting (Snapshot)

[](#processes-voting-overview-off-chain-voting-snapshot)

Off-chain votes are used to measure community sentiment during the early stages of proposal development (Temp Checks and ARFCs). These non-binding votes take place on Snapshot and last for three days, allowing token holders to participate without transaction fees.

##### Onchain Voting (Governance Interfaces)

[](#processes-voting-overview-onchain-voting-governance-interfaces)

Once a proposal reaches the AIP stage, onchain voting is required. Token holders, delegates, or delegators vote on proposals using their AAVE, stkAAVE, or aAAVE tokens. The process is secured through various governance interfaces, including [Aave Labs](https://app.aave.com), [BGD Labs](https://vote.onaave.com), and [Boardroom](https://boardroom.io/aave).

Since voting can occur on multiple networks, this can create limitations for smart contract wallets that only exist on one network. To accommodate this, governance interfaces can be used to setup **voting representatives**, which allows a separate voting address to be designated for each network.

#### Proposal Frameworks

[](#processes-proposal-frameworks)

Aave has predefined frameworks for common types of proposals, simplifying the governance process:

*   [Asset Onboarding Framework](https://governance.aave.com/t/arfc-update-the-asset-onboarding-framework/15629): Standardized lifecycle for onboarding new assets to the protocol, providing a structured process for risk assessments, and community discussions.
    
*   [New Chain Deployment Framework](https://governance.aave.com/t/arfc-new-chain-deployment-framework/15694): Guidelines for deploying Aave on new blockchains, covering security audits, liquidity considerations, and governance approval to support safe and effective multi-chain expansion.
    
*   [Emission Manager Framework](https://governance.aave.com/t/arfc-emission-manager-framework-update/16884): Simplified process for adding emission admins to reserves, improving the management of liquidity incentives.
    
*   [Caps Update Framework](https://governance.aave.com/t/arfc-aave-v3-caps-update-framework/11937): Direct-to-AIP process for adjusting caps or freezing reserves, allowing quicker governance actions to respond to market risks while maintaining protocol stability and liquidity constraints.
    
*   [Direct to AIP Framework](https://governance.aave.com/t/arfc-direct-to-aip-framework/13913): Similar to the Caps Update Framework, but broader in scope, allows certain governance actions to bypass TEMP CHECK & ARFC stages, requiring only an ARFC forum post before AIP creation.
    

These frameworks streamline governance and allow the community to focus on more complex issues while maintaining the protocol's security and adaptability.

### Community

[](#community)

#### Delegates

[](#community-delegates)

Delegates are entrusted with voting power by other community members or through self-delegation. They actively participate in governance by voting on proposals on behalf of those who have delegated their voting rights. Some delegates are compensated through the Orbit program for their contributions.

#### Delegators

[](#community-delegators)

Delegators are community members who hold AAVE, stkAAVE, or aAAVE tokens but choose to delegate their voting power to another individual or entity. This allows them to have their interests represented in governance without directly participating in every vote.

#### Contributors

[](#community-contributors)

Contributors dedicate time and resources to the Aave DAO by engaging in working groups, completing bounties, building on the protocol, or working through grants. These efforts help maintain and improve the Aave ecosystem.

#### Service Providers

[](#community-service-providers)

Service providers offer essential services to the protocol, such as risk management, financial oversight, security, and development. Examples of service providers include:

*   Chaos Labs (Risk)
    
*   Llamarisk (Risk)
    
*   Karpatkey (Finance)
    
*   Certora (Security)
    
*   Tokenlogic (Finance)
    
*   BGD Labs (Development)
    
*   ACI (Growth and Business Development)
    
*   Aave Labs (Development)
    

#### Guardians

[](#community-guardians)

The Aave Community Guardians are a group of community-elected signers authorized to execute limited emergency protections.

The Aave Guardians have responsibilities divided between two multi-signature wallets, with roles and signers listed below.

##### Protocol Emergency Guardian

[](#community-guardians-protocol-emergency-guardian)

The Protocol Emergency Guardian is the holder of the [EMERGENCY\_ADMIN](/docs/developers/smart-contracts/acl-manager#roles-emergency-admin) role for Aave protocol markets and failsafe emergency actor for cross-chain messaging in Emergency Mode.

The Protocol Emergency Guardian is a 5 of 9 multi-signature wallet consisting of the following community-elected signers:

*   Chaos Labs (risk service provider)
    
*   Llamarisk (risk service provider)
    
*   Karpatkey (finance service provider)
    
*   Certora (security service provider)
    
*   Tokenlogic (finance service provider)
    
*   BGD Labs (development service provider)
    
*   ACI (growth and business development service provider)
    
*   Ezr3al (Aave DAO delegate)
    
*   Stable Labs (Aave DAO delegate)
    

##### Governance Emergency Guardian

[](#community-guardians-governance-emergency-guardian)

The Governance Emergency Guardian is tasked to protect the Aave Protocol against potential governance takeovers by having the ability to ‚Äúveto‚Äù an onchain payload if it is deemed malicious.

The Governance Emergency Guardian is a 5 of 9 multi-signature wallet consisting of the following community-elected signers:

*   Seb (Zapper)
    
*   Mounir (Paraswap)
    
*   Gavi Galloway (Standard Crypto)
    
*   Nenad (Defi Saver)

*   Roger (Chainlink community)
    
*   Mariano Conti (DeFi OG)
    
*   Marin (Lido)
    
*   Certora (security service provider)
    

#### Stewards

[](#community-stewards)

Stewards have delegated responsibility over specific protocol parameters, allowing the DAO to quickly respond to market changes. Stewards manage areas such as the GHO stablecoin and liquidity parameters. This system streamlines governance by reducing the need for frequent votes on minor adjustments, promoting efficiency. The source code for GHO Steward contracts can be found on [GitHub](https://github.com/aave/gho-core/tree/main/src/contracts/misc).

## Incentives

[](#incentives)

User AccountsLiquidity PoolGovernance

Incentives within the Aave Protocol encourage active participation from suppliers and borrowers, enhancing liquidity and the overall efficiency of the protocol. It should be noted that there is no one source of various incentive initiatives, but they can originate from multiple sources, including the Aave DAO treasury and external entities interested in promoting liquidity for specific [reserves](/docs/primitives/reserve).

The Aave DAO, governed by AAVE token holders through proposals and voting, can allocate funds from the DAO treasury to incentivise certain activities within the protocol. Incentive programs funded by the DAO are proposed, discussed, and approved through the [Aave Governance](/docs/primitives/governance) process, ensuring community involvement and transparency.

### Liquidity Pool Incentives

[](#liquidity-pool-incentives)

Incentives can also be applied to the supply or borrow side of Aave liquidity pools, promoting activity of the incentivised [reserve](/docs/primitives/reserve). By offering rewards to suppliers and borrowers of certain assets on Aave, the visibility and adoption of tokens can be boosted. Such external incentives require governance approval.

Approved incentives are distributed continuously over time proportional to the amount of liquidity a user supplies or borrows. Users can claim these rewards via the protocol‚Äôs incentive controller, which manages the allocation and distribution of incentives. This system adds value for those actively participating in the protocol while aligning user interests with the health and stability of the Aave ecosystem.

### Safety Module

[](#safety-module)

AAVE holders can stake their tokens in the [Safety Module](/docs/primitives/safety-module), a reserve designed to secure the protocol against unexpected shortfalls. In return for staking their AAVE tokens and taking on the associated risk, participants earn rewards, typically in the form of additional AAVE tokens or other incentives approved by governance. These rewards not only compensate stakers but also enhance the protocol's security by ensuring sufficient reserves are available to cover potential deficits.

### Merit Program

[](#merit-program)

Merit is an Aave-alignment user reward system, designed as a merkle-tree-based periodic airdrop to incentivise Aave-aligned behaviours and enhance the competitiveness of the Aave protocol. More information and interface to access merit distribution can be found [here](https://apps.aavechan.com/merit).

## Liquidity Pool

[](#liquidity-pool)

SupplyBorrow%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

A **liquidity pool** is an Aave market instance that enables users to participate as suppliers or borrowers. Governance-approved parameters, such as reserve configurations and collateralization thresholds, define each pool. Suppliers provide liquidity into the pool that borrowers can access through overcollateralised positions. In return, suppliers earn interest, while borrowers can obtain liquidity against their collateral, all facilitated through decentralised smart contracts.

Aave liquidity pools operate on a blockchain network governed by decisions that define the chain and reserve parameters. Parameter decisions must balance liquidity demands for various actions with risk management. The use of smart contracts validate parameters, executing the actions of borrowing, repaying, and liquidation processes seamlessly without intermediaries. This decentralised approach enhances the transparency, efficiency, and security of financial interactions within the pool.

## Oracle

[](#oracle)

MarketsPriceSequencer uptimePrice Redemption Ratio

Each [reserve](/docs/primitives/reserve) within the Aave Protocol is associated with an oracle contract. These oracle contracts are responsible for reporting the market price of assets in the protocol, which is essential for determining collateralisation requirements.

The oracle for each reserve is selected through Aave Governance, establishing a decentralised model where the community decides which data sources are used. Once chosen, the oracle contract submits price feed updates based on its operational logic (time-based, deviation-based, etc.).

### Types of Oracles in Use

[](#types-of-oracles-in-use)

Currently, there are two primary types of oracle contracts utilised on production Aave markets:

1.  **Chainlink Price Feeds**: Chainlink oracles provide highly reliable, decentralised price data for various assets. These price feeds pull data from multiple sources and aggregate them, minimising the risk of manipulation or outages.
    
2.  **Correlated Assets Price Oracle (CAPO)**: CAPO is designed for assets that have a strong correlation with another asset's price. For example, wrapped tokens can use this oracle to mirror the price of their underlying assets. CAPO leverages specialised logic to adjust and submit prices that follow the movements of these correlated assets. See more details about its implementation on [GitHub](https://github.com/bgd-labs/aave-capo).

## Reserve

[](#reserve)

WETHBorrowing powerLiquidation thresholdInterest rate strategyCapsE-mode

A **reserve** is an instance of a token within an Aave [liquidity pool](/docs/primitives/liquidity-pool). Each reserve is governed by a set of parameters that manage risk and optimise liquidity. These parameters can vary across different markets, even for the same underlying token, allowing Aave to adapt to various network and pool conditions.

### Key Reserve Parameters

[](#key-reserve-parameters)

1.  **Loan-to-Value (LTV)**: The maximum amount that can be borrowed relative to the collateral‚Äôs value. For example, a 75% LTV allows borrowing 75% of the collateral‚Äôs value. An asset with an LTV of 0% cannot be enabled as collateral.
    
2.  **Liquidation Threshold**: Defines the point at which a position becomes at risk of liquidation. If the threshold is exceeded, the position could be liquidated to repay the borrower's debt.
    
3.  **Borrowing Enabled**: Determines whether liquidity of a reserve can be borrowed.
    
4.  **Caps**: Supply and Borrow caps limit the total amount of a token that can be supplied and borrowed from a reserve. These caps are crucial for maintaining liquidity and preventing overexposure during volatile market conditions‚Äã.
    
5.  **Interest Rate Model**: Interest rates in Aave adjust dynamically based on the utilisation of the liquidity pool. As more liquidity is borrowed, interest rates rise to reflect the reduced availability of assets, creating conditions that enough liquidity remains for withdrawals and liquidations. The rates are controlled by parameters that set the base rate and slopes for utilisation‚Äã.
    

### Dynamic Parameters and Governance

[](#dynamic-parameters-and-governance)

The parameters for each reserve are not fixed; they vary between markets and can change over time as Aave Governance monitors market conditions and adjusts settings accordingly. For example, the same underlying token, such as ETH, might have different LTVs or interest rates in Ethereum versus Polygon markets. These adjustments are made to optimise liquidity and risk management for each market. Governance proposals allow the community to vote on changes, such as raising borrow caps or adjusting LTVs, enabling reserves to remain aligned with current market dynamics.

## üìÅ primitives / Safety Module | Aave Protocol Documentation

*ÌååÏùº Í≤ΩÎ°ú: primitives/safety_module.md*

Source: https://aave.com/docs/primitives/safety-module

## Safety Module

[](#safety-module)

The [Umbrella](https://governance.aave.com/t/bgd-aave-safety-module-umbrella/18366) governance proposal outlines potential changes to the Safety Module, including automated slashing, replacing stkAAVE and stkABPT with aToken staking, and new incentives design, subject to community approval.

User AccountsSafety ModuleLiquidity PoolGovernance

Staking in the Aave Safety Module allows AAVE, GHO, and ABPT holders on the Ethereum network to contribute to the protocol's security while earning Safety Incentives. By staking, participants add an additional layer of protection, with the acknowledgement that their assets may be slashed in the event of a shortfall to cover any protocol deficits. Underlying tokens that can be supplied to safety module are listed below:

*   [AAVE](https://etherscan.io/address/0x7fc66500c84a76ad7e9c93437bfc5ac33e2ddae9)
    
*   [ABPT](https://etherscan.io/address/0x3de27efa2f1aa663ae5d458857e731c129069f29) ([Underlying Balancer Token Pool](https://app.balancer.fi/#/ethereum/pool/0x3de27efa2f1aa663ae5d458857e731c129069f29000200000000000000000588))
    
*   [GHO](https://etherscan.io/address/0x40d16fc0246ad3160ccc09b8d0d3a2cd28ae6c2f)
    

### Safety Incentives

[](#safety-incentives)

Safety Incentives are rewards distributed to participants who stake their assets in the Aave Safety Module. These incentives serve as compensation for the risk taken by stakers, whose assets may be slashed to cover protocol deficits in the event of a shortfall. Safety Incentives are primarily distributed in the form of AAVE tokens, and the amount allocated to stakers is determined by Aave Governance through votes on emission parameters.

The emission parameters, which dictate the rate of Safety Incentives, are voted on by the Aave DAO. These parameters are allocated from the Ecosystem Reserve (AAVE Tokens) and/or the Protocol Treasury. Governance votes allow AAVE token holders to influence how much of the reserve or treasury is allocated to these incentives and how they are distributed over time. This decentralised decision-making process aligns incentives with the overall health and security of the Aave ecosystem.

Safety Incentives accumulate over time and can be claimed at any point while tokens are staked or after un-staking from the safety module.

### Slashing Risks

[](#slashing-risks)

When staking in the Aave Safety Module, it‚Äôs important to be aware of the potential slashing risks. Slashing refers to the reduction of staked assets in the event of a shortfall event within the Aave Protocol. This mechanism is in place to protect the protocol by using a portion of staked assets to cover any deficits that may arise. While staking offers rewards through Safety Incentives, there is a risk that a portion of the staked assets could be slashed to contribute to the stability of the Aave ecosystem.

The extent of slashing varies depending on the type of token staked:

*   **stkAAVE and stkABPT**: Maximum slashing risk is up to 30% of the staked assets.
    
*   **stkGHO**: Maximum slashing risk is up to 99% of the staked assets.
    

These risks are an essential consideration for anyone looking to participate in the Aave Safety Module, as they reflect the potential loss of assets in exchange for helping to secure the protocol. The process of identifying and executing a slashing event is subject to an onchain Aave Governance proposal.

## Aave Docs Glossary

[](#aave-docs-glossary)

Term

Description

aTokens

Interest-bearing tokens received by users when they supply assets to Aave. aTokens represent the user‚Äôs share of the liquidity pool and accrue interest in real-time.

APY

Annual Percentage Yield, which is the yield/interest after a year, including compounding interest. This differs from APR, which does not account for compounding effects.

Borrow Cap

A limit set by Aave Governance on the maximum amount of an asset that can be borrowed from the protocol. This helps manage exposure and risk associated with each asset.

Collateral

An asset supplied to Aave to secure a borrowing position. The collateral must exceed the value of the borrowed amount to ensure the protocol's solvency.

Cooldown Period

A mandatory waiting period that stakers must observe before they can unstake their tokens from the Safety Module.

Credit Delegation

A feature where users can delegate their borrowing power to another user who can then take out loans using the collateral of the delegator. This is facilitated through the Aave Protocol's smart contracts.

Debt Ceiling

The maximum amount of debt that can be issued against an isolated asset. Used to limit the risk exposure to a single collateral type.

E-Mode

Efficiency Mode allows borrowers to extract higher borrowing power when using correlated assets (e.g., stablecoins).

Flash Loan

A type of uncollateralized loan offered by Aave, which must be borrowed and repaid within one transaction block.

GHO

A decentralized, overcollateralized stablecoin that is fully backed, transparent, and native to the Aave Protocol. It is governed and managed by the Aave DAO.

Governance Power

Refers to the ability to create proposals or vote in Aave‚Äôs governance system, based on AAVE, stkAAVE, or aAAVE token holdings.

Health Factor

A ratio that determines the health of a user's loan position. It compares the value of the user's collateral to their borrowed assets. A health factor below 1 triggers liquidation.

Isolation Mode

A feature in Aave V3 that limits borrowers to borrowing only certain stablecoins when using assets marked as isolated. It helps mitigate risk by restricting the total debt exposure to a single asset.

Liquidation

The process that occurs when a borrower‚Äôs health factor drops below 1, resulting in the sale of collateral to repay part of the debt and bring the position back to a safer level.

Liquidation Bonus

The bonus provided to liquidators as an incentive to purchase undercollateralized assets in a liquidation event. It is expressed in percentage points.

Liquidation Threshold

The point at which a loan becomes eligible for liquidation due to insufficient collateral relative to borrowed funds. The threshold is defined per asset and determines the collateral value required to maintain a position.

Liquidity Index

Tracks the cumulative interest earned by a reserve over time, used to calculate accurate interest payments.

Loan To Value (LTV)

The maximum percentage of a collateral asset's value that can be borrowed. For example, an LTV of 75% means that for every 1 ETH of collateral, 0.75 ETH can be borrowed.

Network Risk

Risks associated with the blockchain networks on which Aave operates, such as congestion, security vulnerabilities, or network failures.

Oracle

A service used by Aave to fetch external data, such as the prices of assets, which is critical for determining the value of collateral and debt.

Portal

A cross-chain liquidity feature in Aave V3 allowing liquidity to flow between Aave markets on different blockchains. This is made possible through governance-approved bridges.

Ray units

A unit of measurement with 27 decimals, used by Aave for internal calculations to ensure precision, particularly for rates and exchange values.

Reserve Factor

A percentage of interest accrued by borrowers that is allocated to the Aave Treasury to help safeguard the protocol.

Risk Admin

An entity or automated system responsible for adjusting risk parameters in Aave without going through a governance vote. This allows Aave to respond quickly to unforeseen risks.

Safety Module

A staking mechanism where AAVE tokens are staked to act as insurance in case of a shortfall event. Stakers earn rewards but are also exposed to slashing risk.

Siloed Borrowing

A feature in Aave V3 that restricts certain assets to being borrowed alone, mitigating the risk of price manipulation or illiquid assets affecting the protocol's solvency.

Supply Cap

A limit set on the total amount of a particular asset that can be supplied to the Aave protocol.

Utilization Rate

A metric that determines the proportion of borrowed assets to the total available assets in a reserve. A higher utilization rate indicates higher borrowing demand.

Voting Power

The amount of influence a user has in governance decisions, determined by the amount of AAVE, stkAAVE, or aAAVE they hold.

*ÌååÏùº Í≤ΩÎ°ú: resources/web3.md*

Source: https://aave.com/docs/resources/web3

## Web3

[](#web3)

Web3 is the next evolution of the internet where people have control and ownership over their data, the relationships they form online, and their user profile. Together, these make up "social capital": Everyone has it, and it's valuable. In contrast, today when we go on the internet, we visit sites owned by large companies, who own our social capital. These "web2" companies like Amazon, Facebook and Google store user data on privately-held servers and sell it to advertisers in exchange for providing free services. This has led to a good experience for users (free, easy-to-use networks and applications), but it has also caused privacy issues, data manipulation, and limited monetisation options. Web3 addresses these issues by using blockchain technology. This technology is based on user ownership. When people own their data, they can monetise however they want, take their digital information with them (profile, content, data) when they switch networks, and it has the benefit of putting people and apps/networks on an equal footing. Web3 enables a more open and balanced internet, where people have a stake and voice in the future of the internet.

To understand the significant difference between the internet we know today (web2) and web3, take a step back.

When the internet first came about, it was hard to access because there were no easy-to-use applications. Web1 was built on open, public protocols or applications such as TCP, IP, SMTP, and HTTP that builders could develop on top of, plugging into these open protocols to create whatever applications or platforms they wanted. Nobody needed permission to use these foundational protocols or standards to build user-friendly applications like email browsers and marketplaces. These standards are the basic building blocks of the internet. They govern how computers interact with each other and the flow of information. Today, in many senses, we are locked into platforms that own our data.

## Blockchain

[](#blockchain)

A blockchain is a decentralised, distributed ledger system designed to record and verify transactions across a network of computers. This compels that no single entity or company controls the entire network, promoting a system of collective agreement and transparency. Unlike traditional databases that rely on central authorities (private servers owned by companies who set all the rules and make all the decisions), blockchains operate on a peer-to-peer network where every participant, known as nodes, has access to the entire ledger (the information is spread across multiple nodes or computers and each has an entire copy of the information). This decentralisation enhances both security and transparency, as each transaction is visible to all participants and cannot be altered without consensus (all nodes agreeing) from the network.

The core of blockchain technology lies in its unique distributed or decentralised structure. Transactions are grouped into units called "blocks." Each block contains a list of transactions that have been validated (consensus) by the network. Once a block is filled with transactions, it is added to the existing chain of blocks in a sequential manner that is time stamped. This process creates a continuous, unalterable chain of blocks, hence the name "blockchain." Each block contains a reference to the previous block, forming a chronological sequence. This structure makes it extremely difficult to alter any information in a block without changing all subsequent blocks, which would require the consensus of the majority of the network.

## Smart Contracts

[](#smart-contracts)

Smart contracts are self-executing programs that operate deterministically. When an address interacts with a smart contract, the contract executes the agreed-upon actions, such as transferring assets or updating internal accounting. This automation eliminates the need for intermediaries, making transactions more efficient and reducing the potential for human error or manipulation. By relying on code rather than third parties, smart contracts enable trustless and transparent operations, where all parties involved have confidence in the outcome.

Smart contracts are integral to many blockchain applications, as they are executed by blockchain networks like Ethereum, which functions as a global computer network. These networks process and validate the conditions set within each smart contract, updating the state of the contract with every new block added to the chain. This decentralised execution validates that smart contracts run precisely as programmed, without the risk of interference or manipulation. The combination of immutability and public auditability (transparency) in smart contracts provides a high level of trust and security, making them a foundational element in the development of decentralised applications such as identity, finance, and more.

## DeFi

[](#defi)

Decentralised Finance, or DeFi, leverages blockchains and smart contracts to create an open, transparent, and decentralised financial ecosystem. At its core, DeFi aims to improve upon traditional financial systems without the reliance on centralised institutions such as banks, brokers, and financial intermediaries. DeFi offers a novel approach to financial applications, marked by increased accessibility, transparency, and control for users.

DeFi operates on blockchain networks, with Ethereum being the first and most prominent platform. Most of these DeFi applications are now also deployed on Layer 2 blockchains, such as Arbitrum, Optimism, and ZKSync. Unlike traditional financial systems that rely on intermediaries to process and verify transactions, DeFi uses decentralised networks to perform these functions. By removing intermediaries, DeFi aims to lower costs, reduce barriers to entry, and enhance the efficiency of financial transactions.

## Stablecoins

[](#stablecoins)

Stablecoins are digital assets that aim to keep their value constant relative to a reference asset, most commonly fiat currencies like the U.S. dollar, euro, or yen. Unlike Bitcoin or Ethereum, whose values can fluctuate significantly, stablecoins are designed to be predictable and stable, making them useful for everyday transactions, remittances, and as a safe haven during market turbulence.

Stablecoins bridge the gap between traditional finance and the crypto world. They allow users to transfer value globally without major price fluctuations. Here are a few key uses:

*   Remittances: Sending money across borders can be costly and slow. Stablecoins enable faster and cheaper transactions.
    
*   DeFi (Decentralised Finance): Stablecoins are crucial in the DeFi ecosystem, where they are used for supplying, borrowing, and earning interest.
    
*   Hedging: Traders and investors use stablecoins to move out of volatile assets without converting back to fiat.
    
*   Payments: Merchants can accept stablecoins for goods and services without price volatility.
    

Stablecoins achieve stability through various mechanisms:

*   Fiat-collateralised Stablecoins: These are backed by reserves of fiat currency held in a bank account. For every stablecoin issued, an equivalent amount of fiat currency is held in reserve. Examples include Tether (USDT) and USD Coin (USDC).
    
*   Decentralised Stablecoins: These operate without a central authority and are typically issued, redeemed, and governed by smart contracts on a blockchain. Smart contracts can manage the collateral requirements and issuance based on predefined rules in a trustless and transparent process. Aave‚Äôs GHO is one example of this kind of stablecoin.
    
*   Algorithmic Stablecoins: These rely on smart contracts and algorithms to maintain their peg. Instead of being backed by reserves, these stablecoins use mechanisms like minting and burning to control the supply and stabilise the price.
